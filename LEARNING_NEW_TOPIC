Pasted below is a question I have as well as some details about it (and possibly notes on my current understanding). DO NOT tell me the answers. What I want you to do is outline the steps to implement the solution and to solve the problem. At each step, tell me what I should be thinking about, what success looks like, and questions to further my understanding and opportunities for tinkering and exploring. Give analogies where relevant, and include real-world implications that could be thought about. Use what you know about me to customize your instructions using language and analogies that I understand.
