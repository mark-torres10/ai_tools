## Dashboard Design Rubric Checklist

**CRITICAL**: This rubric complements the @llm_evaluation_platform_architect.md and @ai_evals_methodology_expert.md. Focus on the presentation layer - how to make eval data visible, understandable, and actionable for users.

**Core Principle**: "Show, don't tell. The best dashboard is one where users can answer their own questions without documentation."

### Phase 0: Foundation - Understand Your Users
**Purpose**: You can't design an effective dashboard without understanding who will use it and why. Start here, not with wireframes.

- [ ] **Identify User Personas & Workflows**
  - Map out who will use the dashboard (engineers, PMs, researchers, leadership)
  - Document their primary goals (debug failures? compare models? track progress?)
  - Understand their technical level (can they write SQL? understand p-values?)
  - Identify frequency of use (hourly? daily? weekly?)
  
  **User Persona Examples:**
  - ✅ GOOD: "Sarah (ML Engineer): Checks dashboard 5x/day to see if latest prompt improved pass rate. Needs quick pass/fail view + ability to drill into failures."
  - ✅ GOOD: "Mike (PM): Reviews weekly to report to leadership. Needs high-level trends + exportable charts for slides."
  - ❌ BAD: "Engineers will use it" (too vague - what do they need?)
  - ❌ BAD: "Everyone needs everything" (leads to cluttered UI)
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Assuming all users have same needs**: Engineers need details, execs need summaries
  - **Building for yourself**: "I understand it" ≠ "users understand it"
  - **Skipping user research**: Guessing instead of asking
  - **One-size-fits-all**: Same view for all users (overwhelming or insufficient)
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Shadow users: watch them work without a dashboard first
  - Ask "What questions do you need answered?" not "What do you want to see?"
  - Create 3-5 primary user stories: "As [role], I want [goal] so that [outcome]"
  - Test with real users EARLY (sketches, not code)

- [ ] **Define Information Architecture**
  - Organize data hierarchically: Overview → Category → Details
  - Group related metrics together (don't scatter them)
  - Plan navigation: tabs? sidebar? breadcrumbs?
  - Decide what's on homepage vs. deep pages
  
  **Information Hierarchy Pattern:**
  ```
  LEVEL 1 (Homepage - 30 seconds)
  └─ "Is everything OK?" → Big number: 85% pass rate ↑2%
  
  LEVEL 2 (Category view - 2 minutes)
  └─ "Which areas need attention?" → Table: Tasks by category with pass rates
  
  LEVEL 3 (Detail view - 5+ minutes)  
  └─ "Why is this failing?" → Individual task results, model outputs, errors
  ```
  
  **Navigation Examples:**
  - ✅ GOOD: Tabs for "Overview | Tasks | Models | Results" (clear, flat structure)
  - ✅ GOOD: Breadcrumbs: "Home > Math Tasks > Addition > Failed Examples"
  - ❌ BAD: 10 top-level menu items (too many choices)
  - ❌ BAD: Deep nesting: Results > By Model > By Task > By Date > By Metric (lost users)
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Flat structure**: Everything on one page (overwhelming)
  - **Too deep**: Users get lost in navigation (frustrating)
  - **Inconsistent patterns**: Different sections use different navigation
  - **No clear entry point**: Users don't know where to start
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Follow "3-click rule": users should reach any data in ≤3 clicks
  - Use progressive disclosure: summary → details on demand
  - Keep primary navigation visible (sticky header/sidebar)
  - Add search for power users (but design for browse-first)

- [ ] **Choose Metrics to Display**
  - Select 5-10 KEY metrics (not 50)
  - Prioritize: what matters MOST to decisions?
  - Balance leading (predictive) vs. lagging (historical) indicators
  - Align with @ai_evals_methodology_expert metrics
  
  **Metric Selection Framework:**
  ```
  MUST SHOW (Primary KPIs):
  - Overall pass rate (% evals passing)
  - Recent trend (↑↓ from last week)
  - Critical failures (count of must-fix issues)
  
  SHOULD SHOW (Secondary):
  - Pass rate by category/tag
  - Model comparison table
  - Cost spent today/week
  
  NICE TO HAVE (Tertiary):
  - Detailed error breakdowns
  - Latency percentiles
  - Token usage over time
  ```
  
  **Examples:**
  - ✅ GOOD: "Show pass rate, failure count, and top 3 failing tasks" (actionable)
  - ✅ GOOD: "Cost today: $12.50 / $50 budget" (clear status + context)
  - ❌ BAD: Display all 47 metrics on homepage (information overload)
  - ❌ BAD: Show "Total API calls: 1,247" without context (so what?)
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Metric overload**: Showing every metric available
  - **Vanity metrics**: Metrics that look good but don't drive action
  - **No context**: Numbers without baselines, targets, or trends
  - **Conflicting metrics**: Metrics that tell different stories
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Ask: "If this metric changes, what action would we take?"
  - Always show trend: current value + change from baseline
  - Use color sparingly: red = bad, green = good, gray = neutral
  - Add targets/goals: "85% pass rate (goal: 90%)"

**Red Flags in Phase 0:**
- 🚨 You haven't talked to any actual users yet (building blind)
- 🚨 Trying to show everything on one page (overwhelming)
- 🚨 No clear primary metric or KPI (no focus)
- 🚨 Can't explain why each metric matters (vanity metrics)
- 🚨 Navigation structure has >5 levels deep (users will get lost)

### Phase 1: MVP Dashboard - Ship the Basics
**Purpose**: Build the simplest dashboard that provides value. Start with tables and basic charts, not fancy visualizations.

**Guiding Principle**: "Make it work, make it right, make it fast - in that order."

- [ ] **Create Homepage Overview**
  - Show top 3-5 metrics prominently (big numbers)
  - Add recent activity feed (latest eval runs)
  - Include quick actions (Run Eval, View Results)
  - Keep it simple: can be understood in <30 seconds
  
  **Homepage Layout Pattern:**
  ```
  +--------------------------------+
  | 🎯 Pass Rate: 85% (↑ 2%)      |
  | 💰 Cost Today: $12 / $50       |
  | ⚠️  Critical Failures: 3        |
  +--------------------------------+
  | Recent Runs                    |
  | - Run #47: 23/25 passed (2m ago)|
  | - Run #46: 20/25 passed (1h ago)|
  +--------------------------------+
  | [Run New Eval] [View All]      |
  +--------------------------------+
  ```
  
  **Examples:**
  - ✅ GOOD: Single-page dashboard with key metrics + recent activity
  - ✅ GOOD: "At a glance" summary that fits on screen without scrolling
  - ❌ BAD: Complex multi-tab interface for MVP (overengineering)
  - ❌ BAD: Fancy animations and transitions (nice-to-have, not MVP)
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Feature creep**: Adding filters, exports, customization in MVP
  - **Premature optimization**: Worrying about performance with 100 eval runs
  - **Design over function**: Spending days on pixel-perfect styling
  - **No real data**: Building with mock data only (doesn't reveal real issues)
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Use a UI library (Material-UI, Chakra) - don't build from scratch
  - Start with static mockup, get feedback, then code
  - Show real data from day 1 (even if just 5 rows)
  - Timebox MVP: 1-2 weeks max, ship and iterate

- [ ] **Build Results Table**
  - Display eval results in sortable table
  - Include essential columns: Task, Model, Pass/Fail, Score, Date
  - Add basic sorting (click column header)
  - Keep pagination simple (prev/next, or show first 50)
  
  **Table Design:**
  ```
  Task Name    | Model      | Status | Score | Date
  ----------------------------------------------------
  Math: Add    | GPT-4      | ✅ Pass | 95%   | 2m ago
  Safety: PII  | Claude-3   | ❌ Fail | 60%   | 5m ago
  Format: JSON | GPT-3.5    | ✅ Pass | 100%  | 10m ago
  ```
  
  **Must-Have Features:**
  - Sortable columns (click to sort by any column)
  - Visual status indicators (✅ ❌ not just text)
  - Clickable rows (drill into details)
  - Page size: 25-50 rows (not all 10,000!)
  
  **Nice-to-Have (Phase 2+):**
  - Multi-column sorting
  - Column hiding/reordering
  - Inline editing
  - Bulk actions
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Displaying all data**: Loading 10,000 rows crashes browser
  - **No sorting**: Users can't find what they need
  - **Tiny text**: Metrics crammed into small fonts
  - **No click targets**: Can't drill into details
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Use a table library (TanStack Table, AG Grid) - handles sorting, pagination
  - Always show status with color AND icon (accessibility)
  - Make entire row clickable (not just tiny link)
  - Add "Show failed only" toggle (common use case)

- [ ] **Add Basic Filtering**
  - Filter by status (Pass / Fail / All)
  - Filter by model (dropdown or multi-select)
  - Filter by date range (last day / week / month)
  - Start simple: 3-5 filters max
  
  **Filter UI Pattern:**
  ```
  [Status: All ▼] [Model: All ▼] [Date: Last 7 days ▼]
  
  Or inline:
  🔍 Filter by: [✓ Failures only] [Model: GPT-4]
  ```
  
  **Examples:**
  - ✅ GOOD: Simple dropdowns above table
  - ✅ GOOD: Checkboxes for common filters (Show failures only)
  - ❌ BAD: Complex filter builder with AND/OR logic (too complex for MVP)
  - ❌ BAD: 20 filter options (decision paralysis)
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Too many filters**: Overwhelming users with options
  - **Slow filtering**: Re-querying database on every keystroke
  - **No clear all**: Users can't reset filters easily
  - **Hidden filters**: Filters applied but user doesn't know
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Show active filters clearly: "Filtered by: Failures, GPT-4 [Clear]"
  - Client-side filtering for <1000 rows (instant)
  - Server-side filtering for larger datasets
  - Save filter state in URL (shareable links)

**Red Flags in Phase 1:**
- 🚨 Building complex visualizations before basic tables work
- 🚨 No real data in dashboard yet (all mocks)
- 🚨 MVP taking >2 weeks (scope too large)
- 🚨 Designing every edge case (ship and learn)
- 🚨 Dashboard loads slowly even with small data (poor foundation)

### Phase 2: Enhanced Visualizations - Make Data Insights Obvious
**Purpose**: Add charts and visualizations that make trends and patterns immediately visible.

- [ ] **Add Trend Charts**
  - Line chart: Pass rate over time (spot regressions quickly)
  - Bar chart: Pass rate by category (identify weak areas)
  - Keep charts simple: 1-2 metrics per chart
  
  **Chart Examples:**
  - ✅ GOOD: Line chart showing pass rate last 30 days with model version annotations
  - ✅ GOOD: Horizontal bar chart: categories sorted by pass rate (worst first)
  - ❌ BAD: 3D pie chart (hard to read, looks fancy but useless)
  - ❌ BAD: 10 metrics on one chart (unreadable)

- [ ] **Build Comparison Views**
  - Side-by-side model comparison table
  - Diff view: before/after for A/B testing
  - Highlight differences visually (↑ improved, ↓ regressed)

- [ ] **Create Drill-Down Details**
  - Click eval run → see all task results
  - Click failed task → see model output + expected output
  - Show full context for debugging

**Red Flags in Phase 2:**
- 🚨 Charts with no labels or axes (unusable)
- 🚨 Can't click charts to get details (dead end)
- 🚨 Charts load slowly or freeze browser (performance issue)

### Phase 3: Interactivity - Enable Self-Service Analysis
**Purpose**: Let users answer their own questions without asking eng for custom queries.

- [ ] **Advanced Filtering & Search**
  - Multi-select filters (multiple models, tags)
  - Full-text search across tasks
  - Date range picker (custom ranges)
  - Save common filter combinations

- [ ] **Export & Sharing**
  - Export to CSV (for deeper analysis in Excel/Python)
  - Copy shareable link (preserves filters)
  - Screenshot/PDF export for reports
  - Schedule email reports (optional)

- [ ] **Customization**
  - Choose which metrics to show on homepage
  - Reorder dashboard cards
  - Set personal thresholds/alerts
  - Dark mode (nice-to-have)

**Common Pitfalls:**
- **Analysis paralysis**: Too many customization options
- **Slow exports**: Exporting 100K rows crashes
- **Broken links**: Shared URLs don't work (missing query params)

**Red Flags in Phase 3:**
- 🚨 No export capability (data prison)
- 🚨 Filters reset when navigating (frustrating UX)
- 🚨 Can't share specific views (limits collaboration)

### Phase 4: Performance & Polish - Production-Ready
**Purpose**: Make dashboard fast and reliable for daily use.

- [ ] **Optimize Performance**
  - Lazy load data (don't fetch everything upfront)
  - Virtual scrolling for large tables
  - Cache frequently accessed data
  - Target: <2s initial load, <500ms interactions

- [ ] **Add Real-Time Updates**
  - WebSocket updates for running evals
  - Show "New data available" banner
  - Auto-refresh option (configurable)

- [ ] **Improve Accessibility**
  - Keyboard navigation (tab through interface)
  - Screen reader support (ARIA labels)
  - High contrast mode
  - Mobile responsive design

- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - Graceful handling of missing data
  - Clear error messages
  - Retry failed requests
  - Offline mode (show last cached data)

**Red Flags in Phase 4:**
- 🚨 Dashboard unusable on mobile (no responsive design)
- 🚨 No loading states (users think it's broken)
- 🚨 Crashes when data is missing (poor error handling)
- 🚨 Can't use with keyboard only (accessibility fail)

### Meta-Checklist: How to Use This Rubric

- **For New Dashboards**: Phase 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 (in order, don't skip)
- **For Existing Dashboards**: Audit against each phase, identify gaps
- **Time Allocation**:
  - Phase 0: 2-3 days (research, planning)
  - Phase 1: 1-2 weeks (MVP)
  - Phase 2: 1 week (visualizations)
  - Phase 3: 1-2 weeks (interactivity)
  - Phase 4: Ongoing (polish, optimization)

**Success = Dashboard where:**
- ✅ Users can answer "Is everything OK?" in <30 seconds
- ✅ Engineers can debug failures without asking for help
- ✅ PMs can create reports without engineering support
- ✅ Page loads in <2 seconds
- ✅ Users actually use it daily (adoption metrics)
