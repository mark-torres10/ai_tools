## Evals Rubric Checklist

(Sourced from online work from Hamel Husain)

**CRITICAL**: This rubric MUST be consulted for EVERY evaluation-related task. Work through each section systematically, checking off items as you go. Do not skip stages.

### Phase 0: Foundation - Start With Error Analysis
**Purpose**: Error analysis is the foundation of all good evals. You cannot design meaningful evaluations without first understanding how and where your model fails.

**Hamel's Key Insight**: "Error analysis is the most critical activity in evals. It tells you what evals to write and helps you discover failure modes you didn't know existed."

- [ ] **Conduct Manual Error Review**
  - Review a representative sample of model outputs (minimum 50-100 examples)
  - Examine both successful and failed outputs
  - Look at real production data, not synthetic examples
  - Document specific instances where the model fails
  
  **Examples:**
  - ‚úÖ GOOD: Review 100 actual customer support conversations where the AI responded
  - ‚úÖ GOOD: Examine real code generation outputs from your IDE assistant
  - ‚ùå BAD: Create 20 hypothetical scenarios you think might happen
  - ‚ùå BAD: Only review outputs that users reported as failures (misses silent failures)
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Confirmation bias**: Only looking for errors you expect to find
  - **Sample size too small**: 10-20 examples won't reveal patterns
  - **Cherry-picking**: Only reviewing "interesting" cases and missing common failures
  - **Ignoring context**: Not capturing the full conversation/interaction context
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Use stratified sampling: include easy, medium, hard examples
  - Review outputs chronologically to catch temporal patterns
  - Include a "success audit" - why did good outputs work?
  - Involve multiple reviewers to catch different error types

- [ ] **Categorize Error Types**
  - Create a taxonomy of failure modes (e.g., hallucinations, refusals, formatting errors, factual errors)
  - Count frequency of each error type
  - Assess severity/impact of each error category
  - Identify patterns: Does the model fail on specific topics, formats, or edge cases?
  
  **Example Error Categories:**
  - **Hallucinations**: Model invents facts, features, or capabilities
    - Example: "Our API supports GraphQL subscriptions" (when it doesn't)
  - **Format violations**: Breaks expected output structure
    - Example: Returns plain text when JSON was required
  - **Refusal failures**: Won't answer questions it should answer
    - Example: Refusing to explain basic programming concepts as "potentially harmful"
  - **Over-confidence**: Gives wrong answers with high confidence
    - Example: "I'm certain the bug is in line 42" (it's not)
  - **Under-confidence**: Refuses or hedges on questions it should know
    - Example: "I'm not sure what Python is" (basic knowledge)
  - **Context loss**: Forgets earlier parts of conversation
    - Example: Contradicts itself 3 messages later
  - **Instruction following**: Ignores specific user instructions
    - Example: User says "be concise" but model gives 500-word essay
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Too granular**: 50 error categories that overlap (hard to act on)
  - **Too broad**: "Model is wrong" as a single category (not actionable)
  - **Subjective categories**: "Bad tone" without clear definition
  - **Missing quantification**: Not counting how often each error occurs
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Start with 5-10 broad categories, refine as needed
  - Define each category with 3-5 concrete examples
  - Create a decision tree for ambiguous cases
  - Track inter-rater reliability if multiple people categorize

- [ ] **Prioritize Error Categories**
  - Rank errors by: frequency √ó severity √ó user impact
  - Focus eval development on top 3-5 error categories first
  - Document why these categories matter for your use case
  
  **Prioritization Framework:**
  ```
  Priority Score = (Frequency √ó Severity √ó User Impact) / Difficulty to Fix
  
  Frequency: 1-10 (how often does this occur?)
  Severity: 1-10 (how bad is it when it happens?)
  User Impact: 1-10 (how much does this hurt users?)
  Difficulty: 1-10 (how hard to create evals for this?)
  ```
  
  **Examples:**
  - ‚úÖ HIGH PRIORITY: Hallucinations about pricing (Freq: 8, Sev: 10, Impact: 10) ‚Üí Score: 800
  - ‚úÖ MEDIUM PRIORITY: Minor formatting issues (Freq: 9, Sev: 3, Impact: 4) ‚Üí Score: 108
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è LOW PRIORITY: Rare edge case with low impact (Freq: 1, Sev: 2, Impact: 2) ‚Üí Score: 4
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Scope creep**: Trying to eval everything at once (overwhelming)
  - **Perfectionism**: Refusing to ship evals until all errors covered
  - **Ignoring user impact**: Fixing annoying bugs that don't hurt users
  - **Forgetting severity**: Focusing on frequent but harmless errors
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Start with top 3 error categories, ship evals for those first
  - Re-prioritize monthly as you fix issues and discover new ones
  - Consider business metrics (revenue impact, churn risk)
  - Quick wins matter: sometimes tackle easy wins to build momentum

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: Do NOT proceed to Phase 1 without completing thorough error analysis. Building evals without understanding failures leads to meaningless metrics.

**Red Flags in Phase 0:**
- üö® You spent <2 hours on error analysis (not enough)
- üö® You haven't looked at production data (flying blind)
- üö® You have 1 broad error category or 50 specific ones (wrong granularity)
- üö® You can't explain why top priority errors matter to users (not grounded)
- üö® You're categorizing errors alone (need diverse perspectives)

### Phase 1: Eval Design - Ground Everything in Truth
**Purpose**: Design evaluations that measure what actually matters and are grounded in reality.

**Hamel's Key Insight**: "The biggest mistake is using synthetic data or toy examples. Evals must reflect real-world complexity and actual user needs, not what you imagine users need."

- [ ] **Define Clear, Specific Objectives**
  - State exactly what behavior you're evaluating (be specific, not vague)
  - Align objectives with real user needs and production use cases
  - Ensure objectives address the error categories identified in Phase 0
  - Ask: "If this eval passes, does it actually mean the model is better for users?"
  
  **Examples:**
  - ‚úÖ GOOD: "Model correctly extracts due dates from lease agreements in MM/DD/YYYY format"
  - ‚úÖ GOOD: "Model refuses to answer medical diagnosis questions without disclaimers"
  - ‚úÖ GOOD: "Generated code compiles and passes basic linting checks"
  - ‚ùå BAD: "Model produces good outputs" (too vague)
  - ‚ùå BAD: "Improve code quality" (not measurable)
  - ‚ùå BAD: "Better user experience" (subjective, not specific)
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Vanity metrics**: Measuring things that look good but don't matter
    - Example: "95% of responses are >500 words" (length ‚â† quality)
  - **Proxy metrics**: Measuring proxies instead of actual goals
    - Example: Testing "uses professional language" when you care about "resolves user issues"
  - **Multiple objectives**: Trying to measure 5 things in one eval
    - Example: "Eval checks accuracy, tone, brevity, safety, and formatting" (split these)
  - **Misaligned objectives**: Eval doesn't match real success criteria
    - Example: Testing factual accuracy when real issue is instruction following
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Write objectives as "Given X, the model should Y"
  - Make objectives falsifiable: you can construct a test that fails
  - Tie each objective back to Phase 0 error categories
  - If you can't write 5 concrete examples, objective is too vague

- [ ] **Use Real Data, Not Synthetic Data**
  - Source evaluation examples from actual production data or real user queries
  - Avoid creating "toy examples" that don't reflect real complexity
  - Include edge cases and difficult examples from error analysis
  - Ensure data distribution matches what you'll see in production
  
  **Examples:**
  - ‚úÖ GOOD: Pull 50 actual customer support tickets from last month
  - ‚úÖ GOOD: Use real code snippets from your production codebase
  - ‚úÖ GOOD: Sample actual questions users asked your chatbot
  - ‚ùå BAD: Make up "realistic-seeming" customer questions
  - ‚ùå BAD: Use only examples from public datasets (may not match your domain)
  - ‚ùå BAD: Generate examples with GPT-4 (synthetic, lacks real complexity)
  
  **Real vs Synthetic Comparison:**
  ```
  SYNTHETIC (BAD):
  "What is the capital of France?"
  "Paris"
  
  REAL (GOOD):
  "hey i need to know the capital city for france im writing 
  a travel blog post and want to make sure i get it right also 
  what should i visit there thanks!!!"
  
  Why? Real data has:
  - Typos and informal language
  - Multiple questions in one
  - Context and intent that matters
  - Messiness that trips up models
  ```
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Synthetic data bias**: GPT-generated questions are too clean, miss real complexity
  - **Public dataset mismatch**: SQUAD dataset doesn't match your customer support domain
  - **Outdated data**: Using data from 6 months ago when product has changed
  - **Privacy violations**: Using real data without proper anonymization
  - **Unrepresentative sampling**: Only using "interesting" examples, missing common cases
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - For new products without production data: user test with real users, record sessions
  - Anonymize PII carefully: names, emails, phone numbers, addresses
  - Mix data sources: production logs + user research + error reports
  - Weight by frequency: if 80% of queries are basic, 80% of evals should be too
  - Red team your evals: try to game them with synthetic data, then fix

- [ ] **Establish Ground Truth Carefully**
  - For each eval case, define what the "correct" answer/behavior is
  - Ground truth should come from: real human judgments, verified facts, or domain experts
  - Document WHY each ground truth label is correct
  - Be honest about ambiguous cases - flag them rather than forcing labels
  - For LLM-as-judge evals: validate judge outputs against human agreement (aim for >80% agreement)
  
  **Ground Truth Sources (in order of reliability):**
  1. **Verified facts**: Checkable against authoritative source
     - Example: "Paris is capital of France" ‚Üí verify with atlas
  2. **Domain expert judgment**: Expert in field labels the answer
     - Example: Doctor labels medical diagnosis as correct/incorrect
  3. **Consensus human judgment**: 3+ humans agree on label
     - Example: 5 annotators all rate response as "helpful"
  4. **User feedback**: Real user indicated if output was good
     - Example: User clicked "üëç" on chatbot response
  5. **Procedural checks**: Output follows required procedure
     - Example: Code compiles and passes tests
  
  **Examples:**
  - ‚úÖ GOOD: "Answer is 'Paris' because Wikipedia, Britannica, and atlas all confirm"
  - ‚úÖ GOOD: "3 lawyers agreed this contract summary is accurate (83% inter-rater agreement)"
  - ‚úÖ GOOD: "User marked response as helpful and continued conversation"
  - ‚ùå BAD: "I think Paris is probably right" (not verified)
  - ‚ùå BAD: "GPT-4 says this is correct" (circular - LLM judging LLM)
  - ‚ùå BAD: "Seems like a good response to me" (no documentation)
  
  **Handling Ambiguous Cases:**
  ```
  Question: "Is this response professional?"
  
  BAD: Force a yes/no label even though it's subjective
  
  GOOD: Create rubric with specific criteria:
  - Uses formal language (yes/no)
  - Avoids slang (yes/no)  
  - Respectful tone (yes/no)
  - Then require 2/3 or 3/3 to pass
  
  BETTER: Flag ambiguous cases:
  - Add "ambiguous" label with reason
  - Track ambiguous cases separately
  - Don't use for model comparison (unreliable)
  - Potentially exclude from headline metrics
  ```
  
  **LLM-as-Judge Validation:**
  - **CRITICAL**: Judge must be validated against humans, not assumed correct
  - Process:
    1. Have LLM judge label 100 examples
    2. Have humans label same 100 examples  
    3. Calculate agreement rate: (# agreements) / (# total)
    4. Target: >80% agreement (>90% is better)
    5. If <80%: fix judge prompt or switch to human eval
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Circular evaluation**: Using GPT-4 to judge GPT-4 outputs (biased)
  - **Unjustified labels**: Labeling without documentation ("trust me")
  - **Ignoring ambiguity**: Forcing labels on subjective cases
  - **Single annotator**: One person's opinion becomes "truth" (unreliable)
  - **Outdated ground truth**: Facts change but labels don't get updated
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Write "labeling guidelines" doc: how to decide each label
  - Track inter-rater reliability: do multiple humans agree?
  - Review disagreements: why did annotators differ? Refine guidelines
  - Version ground truth: if you fix a wrong label, increment dataset version
  - Sample check: periodically audit ground truth quality

- [ ] **Version Your Eval Dataset**
  - Assign version numbers to eval datasets (e.g., v1.0, v1.1)
  - Document what changed between versions and why
  - Track performance across dataset versions to detect eval drift
  - Never modify existing eval cases - always add new ones to preserve comparability
  
  **Versioning Scheme:**
  ```
  v1.0 ‚Üí v1.1: Added 20 new test cases (patch: additions only)
  v1.1 ‚Üí v2.0: Changed ground truth for 5 cases (major: breaking change)
  v2.0 ‚Üí v2.1: Added new category tag to metadata (patch: non-breaking)
  ```
  
  **What to Document:**
  - Date of version
  - Number of eval cases added/modified/removed
  - Reason for change
  - Performance impact (did scores change?)
  - Who made the change
  
  **Examples:**
  - ‚úÖ GOOD: "v2.1 (2024-01-15): Added 15 cases for hallucination category. Model score dropped from 85% ‚Üí 78%, expected due to harder cases. - @john"
  - ‚úÖ GOOD: "v3.0 (2024-02-01): Fixed ground truth for 10 cases that were mislabeled. BREAKING: Model comparisons before/after v3.0 not directly comparable."
  - ‚ùå BAD: "Updated eval set" (no version, no docs)
  - ‚ùå BAD: Silently changing labels in existing cases (breaks reproducibility)
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **No versioning**: Can't reproduce results from last week
  - **Modifying existing cases**: Breaks ability to compare model versions over time
  - **Undocumented changes**: "Why did scores change?" ‚Üí nobody knows
  - **Version sprawl**: Creating new version for every tiny change (overhead)
  - **Lost history**: Deleting old versions (can't debug regressions)
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Use git for eval datasets: automatic versioning and history
  - Freeze versions when reporting results: "Model A scored 85% on eval-v2.3"
  - Keep changelog: document every version in CHANGELOG.md
  - Semantic versioning: major = breaking, minor = additions, patch = metadata
  - Archive old versions but keep them accessible for debugging

**Red Flags in Phase 1:**
- üö® Your eval examples are all made up, not from real users
- üö® You can't explain why a ground truth label is correct
- üö® You're using the same LLM to generate and evaluate
- üö® You have no version control on eval datasets
- üö® Your LLM-as-judge agrees with humans <70% of the time
- üö® You've never documented why you chose specific objectives

### Phase 2: Eval Implementation - Choose the Right Approach
**Purpose**: Select and implement evaluation methods that are reliable, maintainable, and appropriate for the task.

**Hamel's Key Insight**: "Don't use LLM-as-judge for everything. Code-based assertions are faster, cheaper, and more reliable when applicable. Reserve LLM judges for truly subjective evaluations."

- [ ] **Choose Appropriate Eval Method(s)**
  - **Code-based assertions**: For deterministic checks (format, structure, required elements)
  - **LLM-as-judge**: For subjective/nuanced evaluation (quality, coherence, relevance)
  - **Human evaluation**: For highly subjective or critical cases
  - **Hybrid approach**: Combine methods when needed
  - Document why you chose each method
  
  **Decision Matrix:**
  | Eval Type | Best Method | Example |
  |-----------|-------------|---------|
  | Format/Structure | Code assertions | "Output is valid JSON" |
  | Factual correctness | Code + knowledge base | "Date matches database" |
  | Instruction following | Code assertions | "Includes required sections" |
  | Tone/Style | LLM-as-judge | "Response is empathetic" |
  | Quality/Coherence | LLM-as-judge | "Explanation is clear" |
  | Safety/Ethics | Human + LLM | "Response avoids bias" |
  | Complex reasoning | Human evaluation | "Solution approach is valid" |
  
  **Examples:**
  - ‚úÖ GOOD: Use regex to check email format (fast, deterministic)
  - ‚úÖ GOOD: Use LLM-as-judge for "Is this explanation helpful?" (subjective)
  - ‚úÖ GOOD: Human eval for high-stakes medical advice (safety-critical)
  - ‚ùå BAD: Use LLM-as-judge to check if output is valid JSON (overkill, slow)
  - ‚ùå BAD: Use code assertions for "Is writing engaging?" (won't work)
  - ‚ùå BAD: No human oversight for safety-critical applications (risky)
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **LLM-judge overuse**: Using LLMs when simple code would work (slow, expensive)
  - **Underusing code**: Trying to LLM-judge deterministic properties
  - **No validation**: Assuming LLM-as-judge is accurate without checking
  - **Wrong granularity**: One eval trying to check 10 different things
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Start with code assertions where possible (faster, cheaper, more reliable)
  - Use "tiered" approach: code assertions filter, then LLM-judge on subset
  - Combine methods: code checks structure, LLM judges content quality
  - Document trade-offs: why you chose each method for each eval

- [ ] **If Using LLM-as-Judge, Validate Carefully**
  - Use a DIFFERENT model as judge than the one being evaluated
  - Test judge reliability: manually review 50-100 judge decisions
  - Calculate agreement rate between judge and humans (target >80%)
  - Version your judge prompts and track judge model versions
  - Be skeptical: LLM judges can be biased or inconsistent
  
  **Judge Setup Best Practices:**
  ```python
  # BAD: Same model judges itself
  model = "gpt-4"
  judge = "gpt-4"  # ‚ùå Circular, biased
  
  # GOOD: Different model as judge
  model = "gpt-4"
  judge = "claude-3-opus"  # ‚úÖ Independent
  
  # BETTER: Multiple judges
  model = "gpt-4"
  judges = ["claude-3-opus", "gpt-4-turbo", "human"]  # ‚úÖ Ensemble
  ```
  
  **Judge Prompt Template:**
  ```
  You are evaluating an AI assistant's response.

  Criteria: [SPECIFIC, MEASURABLE CRITERIA]
  - [Criterion 1 with examples of pass/fail]
  - [Criterion 2 with examples of pass/fail]

  User Query: {query}
  AI Response: {response}

  Evaluate the response on ONLY the criteria above.
  Provide:
  1. Score: PASS or FAIL
  2. Reasoning: 1-2 sentences explaining why
  3. Confidence: HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW

  Be strict. When in doubt, FAIL.
  ```
  
  **Validation Process:**
  1. Run judge on 100 test cases
  2. Have humans judge same 100 cases independently
  3. Calculate agreement: `matches / total`
  4. Review disagreements: where does judge fail?
  5. Iterate judge prompt based on failures
  6. Re-validate until >80% agreement
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **No validation**: Trusting LLM judge without verification (risky)
  - **Circular judging**: GPT-4 judging GPT-4 (systematically biased)
  - **Vague criteria**: "Is this good?" (judge will be inconsistent)
  - **Forgetting to version**: Judge prompt changes, can't reproduce results
  - **Ignoring confidence**: Judge says "FAIL/LOW confidence" but you count it (unreliable)
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Make judge STRICT by default (minimize false positives)
  - Use structured output: JSON with score, reasoning, confidence
  - Track judge disagreements: these are ambiguous cases to review
  - A/B test judge prompts: which one agrees more with humans?
  - Consider judge cost: GPT-4 judges are expensive at scale

- [ ] **Implement Uncertainty & Refusal Checks**
  - Test if model appropriately expresses uncertainty when it should
  - Test if model refuses to answer when it lacks information
  - Measure calibration: does model confidence match actual correctness?
  - Include "should refuse" test cases in your eval set
  
  **Why This Matters:**
  - **Overconfident models**: Say "I'm certain X" when X is wrong (dangerous)
  - **Underconfident models**: Refuse to answer basic questions (bad UX)
  - **Poorly calibrated**: Confidence doesn't match correctness (misleading)
  
  **Test Cases to Include:**
  ```
  1. SHOULD BE CONFIDENT (has info):
     Q: "What's 2+2?"
     Expected: Confident answer "4"
     
  2. SHOULD BE UNCERTAIN (ambiguous):
     Q: "Is this stock a good buy?"
     Expected: Hedging, caveats, "depends on..."
     
  3. SHOULD REFUSE (lacks info):
     Q: "What's my account password?"
     Expected: Clear refusal with reason
     
  4. SHOULD REFUSE (out of scope):
     Q: "How do I hack a computer?"
     Expected: Refusal + explanation of why
  ```
  
  **Measuring Calibration:**
  ```
  For each response where model expresses confidence:
  - Bucket by confidence level (high/med/low)
  - Measure actual correctness rate
  - Compare: do they match?
  
  WELL CALIBRATED:
  - High confidence ‚Üí 90%+ correct
  - Medium confidence ‚Üí 70-90% correct  
  - Low confidence ‚Üí <70% correct
  
  POORLY CALIBRATED:
  - High confidence ‚Üí 60% correct (overconfident!)
  - Low confidence ‚Üí 95% correct (underconfident)
  ```
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **No refusal tests**: Model never tested on "should refuse" cases
  - **Penalizing uncertainty**: Marking hedging as failure when appropriate
  - **Ignoring calibration**: Only measuring accuracy, not confidence
  - **Binary thinking**: Expecting 100% confidence or 0%, nothing in between
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Create "adversarial" test cases: trick questions where model should refuse
  - Test boundary cases: where should model shift from confident to uncertain?
  - Track refusal rate over time: if it spikes, investigate why
  - Consider domain: medical advice needs different calibration than trivia

- [ ] **Version Control Everything**
  - Prompts: version control system prompts AND eval prompts
  - Models: track exact model versions/checkpoints being evaluated
  - Judge models: if using LLM-as-judge, track judge model version
  - Eval code: version control the evaluation harness code itself
  - Create reproducible eval runs that can be re-run identically
  
  **What to Track:**
  ```
  eval_run_metadata = {
    "run_id": "eval_20240115_143022",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:30:22Z",
    "eval_dataset_version": "v2.3",
    "system_prompt_version": "v1.5",
    "judge_prompt_version": "v1.2",
    "model_being_evaluated": "gpt-4-0125-preview",
    "judge_model": "claude-3-opus-20240229",
    "eval_harness_version": "v0.4.1",
    "git_commit": "a3f5d9c",
    "environment": "production"
  }
  ```
  
  **Reproducibility Checklist:**
  - [ ] Can I re-run this exact eval 6 months from now?
  - [ ] Do I know which prompt version was used?
  - [ ] Do I know which model checkpoint was evaluated?
  - [ ] Is the eval dataset versioned and accessible?
  - [ ] Is the eval code in git with proper tags?
  - [ ] Are random seeds set for deterministic results?
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Prompts not versioned**: "Which prompt did we use?" ‚Üí nobody knows
  - **Model version ambiguity**: "gpt-4" (which snapshot? changes over time)
  - **Lost eval code**: Eval script was in local file, now lost
  - **No metadata**: Can't reproduce results from last month
  - **Dependency drift**: Eval code breaks because library updated
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Use git tags for eval runs: `git tag eval-v2.3-run-20240115`
  - Store metadata with results: every CSV has version info
  - Pin dependencies: `requirements.txt` with exact versions
  - Archive model checkpoints: don't rely on API "gpt-4" staying same
  - Use deterministic APIs: set temperature=0, seed for reproducibility

**Red Flags in Phase 2:**
- üö® Using LLM-as-judge without validating against humans
- üö® Same model judging itself (circular evaluation)
- üö® No refusal or uncertainty test cases
- üö® Can't reproduce eval results from last week
- üö® Don't know which prompt/model version was used
- üö® Using LLM-judge for deterministic checks (wasteful)

### Phase 3: Eval Integration - Make Evals Actionable
**Purpose**: Integrate evals into your development workflow so they drive continuous improvement.

- [ ] **Integrate into Development Workflow**
  - Run evals automatically on every significant change (new prompt, new model, new features)
  - Set up CI/CD to run core evals on every commit/PR
  - Create dashboards showing eval performance over time
  - Make eval results visible to entire team

- [ ] **Create Clear Pass/Fail Criteria**
  - Define thresholds for each eval (e.g., "95% accuracy on formatting evals")
  - Document why each threshold was chosen
  - Have both "must-pass" evals (blockers) and "monitor" evals (track but don't block)
  - Review and adjust thresholds based on production performance

- [ ] **Enable Rapid Iteration**
  - Evals should run fast enough to not block development (target: <5 min for core eval suite)
  - Prioritize a small set of critical evals that run on every change
  - Have larger, comprehensive eval suites that run less frequently
  - Cache results when appropriate to speed up eval runs

- [ ] **Document and Communicate Results**
  - Create eval reports that are understandable to non-technical stakeholders
  - Show trends over time, not just current snapshots
  - Highlight regressions immediately and loudly
  - Celebrate improvements to build buy-in for evals investment

### Phase 4: Continuous Improvement - Iterate on Evals
**Purpose**: Evals are never "done" - they must evolve with your product and new failure modes.

- [ ] **Regular Error Analysis (Ongoing)**
  - Schedule recurring error analysis sessions (weekly or bi-weekly)
  - Review new production failures and add them to eval set
  - Look for patterns in what current evals are missing
  - Archive evals that no longer provide value

- [ ] **Monitor Eval Quality**
  - Track eval "false positive" rate: evals that pass but shouldn't
  - Track eval "false negative" rate: evals that fail but shouldn't
  - Review eval failures to confirm they're real issues, not eval bugs
  - Retire or fix evals that are unreliable or no longer relevant

- [ ] **Expand Eval Coverage**
  - Identify gaps: what behaviors aren't covered by current evals?
  - Add evals for new features as they're developed
  - Increase diversity of eval cases (topics, formats, difficulty)
  - Target: every significant error category has at least 10+ eval cases

- [ ] **Measure and Communicate Eval ROI**
  - Track bugs caught by evals before production
  - Measure: "Did evals prevent a regression from shipping?"
  - Show stakeholders concrete examples of evals providing value
  - Use successes to justify continued investment in eval infrastructure

### Phase 5: Advanced Eval Practices - Level Up
**Purpose**: Once basics are solid, adopt advanced practices for even better evaluation.

- [ ] **Implement Prompt Versioning Strategy**
  - Keep prompts in version control, close to code (not in external tools)
  - Use prompt templating for maintainability
  - Track which prompt version was used for each eval run
  - Balance: make prompts accessible to non-engineers while keeping them in code

- [ ] **Create Eval Suites by Category**
  - Organize evals into suites: formatting, factuality, safety, refusal, etc.
  - Enable running specific suites for targeted testing
  - Track metrics separately for each suite
  - Allows focused improvement on specific dimensions

- [ ] **Build Eval Dataset Diversity**
  - Ensure evals cover diverse: topics, difficulty levels, user types, edge cases
  - Tag eval cases with metadata (difficulty, category, source)
  - Analyze performance by subgroup to find weak spots
  - Actively add eval cases from underrepresented categories

- [ ] **Adopt Experimental Mindset**
  - Treat each prompt/model change as an experiment
  - Define hypothesis and success criteria before making changes
  - Use evals to validate hypotheses objectively
  - Accept that some experiments will fail - that's valuable information

- [ ] **Share Eval Best Practices**
  - Document your eval methodology and share with team
  - Create templates for common eval patterns
  - Run eval training/workshops for team members
  - Build a culture where everyone values and contributes to evals

### Red Flags - Stop and Reassess If You See These

üö® **STOP**: You're building evals without doing error analysis first
üö® **STOP**: You're using only synthetic/made-up data instead of real examples  
üö® **STOP**: You're using the same model to generate and evaluate outputs
üö® **STOP**: Your eval dataset has <20 examples (too small to be meaningful)
üö® **STOP**: You don't have ground truth - you're guessing at correct answers
üö® **STOP**: Your LLM-as-judge agrees with humans <70% of the time (unreliable)
üö® **STOP**: Evals take >30min to run (too slow, will be skipped)
üö® **STOP**: You can't reproduce eval results from last week
üö® **STOP**: You're building evals but never looking at production errors
üö® **STOP**: Stakeholders don't understand or care about eval results (communication failure)

### Meta-Checklist: How to Use This Rubric

- **For New Eval Projects**: Work through Phases 0‚Üí1‚Üí2‚Üí3 in order. Do not skip.
- **For Existing Evals**: Use Phase 4 continuously. Review Phase 5 for improvements.
- **For Eval Reviews**: Use this checklist to audit existing evals and identify gaps.
- **Frequency**: 
  - Phase 0 (Error Analysis): Weekly or bi-weekly ongoing
  - Phases 1-3: For each new eval category or major feature
  - Phase 4: Continuous, built into workflow
  - Phase 5: Quarterly review and improvement
  
**Remember**: Perfect is the enemy of good. Start with Phase 0 (error analysis) and a small set of solid evals. Expand from there. Better to have 10 high-quality, actionable evals than 100 unreliable ones.
