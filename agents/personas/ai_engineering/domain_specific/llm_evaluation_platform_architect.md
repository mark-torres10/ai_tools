## Eval Platform Architecture Rubric Checklist

**CRITICAL**: This rubric MUST be consulted for EVERY evaluation platform design or implementation task. Work through each section systematically. The goal is to build an eval platform that enables rapid iteration, not one that becomes a bottleneck.

**Hamel's Key Insight**: "Keep your eval infrastructure simple and close to your code. The best eval platform is one that developers actually use because it's fast, reliable, and doesn't get in their way."

### Phase 0: Foundation - Requirements & Constraints
**Purpose**: Understand what you're building and why before writing code. Most platform failures come from building the wrong thing.

- [ ] **Define Platform Scope & Constraints**
  - Document exactly what the platform needs to do (start small!)
  - Identify who will use it (engineers, researchers, PMs?)
  - Define performance requirements (eval latency, throughput)
  - Set budget constraints (API costs, infrastructure costs)
  - Decide: build vs. buy (consider existing tools like Braintrust, LangSmith)
  
  **Examples:**
  - ‚úÖ GOOD: "Platform runs 100 evals/day, <5min eval time, $50/day API budget, used by 5 engineers"
  - ‚úÖ GOOD: "Start with support for OpenAI + Anthropic, add others later based on need"
  - ‚ùå BAD: "Build a comprehensive eval platform that supports everything" (scope creep)
  - ‚ùå BAD: "We need enterprise-grade scalability" (for 3 users running 10 evals/week - overengineering)
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Overengineering**: Building for scale you don't need yet
  - **Feature creep**: Trying to solve every eval problem on day 1
  - **Wrong abstraction**: Abstracting before you understand the problem
  - **Ignoring users**: Building what you think they need, not what they actually need
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Start with single LLM provider, add more when needed
  - Begin with synchronous execution, add async only if needed
  - Use SQLite initially, move to PostgreSQL when you have real scale needs
  - Interview your users: what would make evals EASIER for them?

- [ ] **Choose Architecture Pattern**
  - Decide: monolith vs. microservices (monolith is fine for small teams!)
  - Determine deployment model (local, cloud, hybrid)
  - Pick tech stack based on team expertise (don't cargo cult)
  - Plan for iteration speed over perfection
  
  **Decision Matrix:**
  | Team Size | Eval Volume | Recommended Architecture |
  |-----------|-------------|--------------------------|
  | 1-5 people | <1000/day | Simple Python scripts + SQLite |
  | 5-15 people | 1K-10K/day | FastAPI + PostgreSQL |
  | 15+ people | >10K/day | Microservices + message queue |
  
  **Examples:**
  - ‚úÖ GOOD: "FastAPI backend + React frontend, PostgreSQL, deployed on Railway" (clear, pragmatic)
  - ‚úÖ GOOD: "Python scripts in repo that write results to CSV, versioned in git" (start simple!)
  - ‚ùå BAD: "Kubernetes cluster with 12 microservices for MVP" (massive overkill)
  - ‚ùå BAD: "Let's use this new framework I want to learn" (wrong motivation)
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Premature microservices**: Splitting before you understand boundaries
  - **Technology resume building**: Choosing tech to pad resume, not solve problem
  - **Not invented here syndrome**: Rebuilding what exists (logging, monitoring, etc.)
  - **Analysis paralysis**: Spending weeks on architecture docs before writing code
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Start with monolith, extract microservices only when clear need emerges
  - Use boring, proven technology that your team knows
  - Deploy early, even if it's just running on your laptop
  - Bias towards simplicity: you can always add complexity later

- [ ] **Design Data Model**
  - Define core entities (Tasks, Models, EvalRuns, Results)
  - Plan for versioning from day 1 (eval datasets, prompts, models)
  - Design for queryability (how will you slice results?)
  - Consider retention policies (how long to keep results?)
  
  **Core Schema (Simplified):**
  ```sql
  -- Tasks: What you're evaluating
  CREATE TABLE eval_tasks (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    task_version VARCHAR NOT NULL,  -- Critical!
    name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    input TEXT NOT NULL,
    expected_output TEXT,
    ground_truth JSONB,
    metadata JSONB,  -- Tags, category, etc.
    created_at TIMESTAMP
  );
  
  -- Models: What you're testing
  CREATE TABLE models (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    provider VARCHAR,  -- openai, anthropic
    model_name VARCHAR,  -- gpt-4, claude-3-opus
    prompt_version VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    config JSONB,  -- Temp, max_tokens, etc.
    created_at TIMESTAMP
  );
  
  -- Results: Eval outcomes
  CREATE TABLE eval_results (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    task_id UUID REFERENCES eval_tasks(id),
    model_id UUID REFERENCES models(id),
    model_output TEXT,
    passed BOOLEAN,
    score FLOAT,
    latency_ms INTEGER,
    cost_usd DECIMAL(10,6),
    evaluated_at TIMESTAMP
  );
  ```
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **No versioning**: Can't reproduce results from last month
  - **Missing metadata**: No way to filter/group results later
  - **Wrong granularity**: Storing too much or too little detail
  - **No timestamps**: Can't track when evals were run
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Use JSONB for flexible metadata (future-proof)
  - Always include created_at, updated_at timestamps
  - Store full context for debugging (input + output + config)
  - Plan for migrations: use Alembic/Flyway from day 1

**Red Flags in Phase 0:**
- üö® Can't explain platform scope in 2 sentences (too vague)
- üö® Choosing architecture without understanding scale needs
- üö® No data versioning strategy (can't reproduce results)
- üö® Building microservices for team of 3 (overengineering)
- üö® No clear users or use cases (building in vacuum)

### Phase 1: Core Platform - Build the Minimum Viable System
**Purpose**: Build the simplest thing that works. Add complexity only when needed.

**Hamel's Key Insight**: "Keep prompts and eval code close to your application code, ideally in the same repo. Don't build a separate system that becomes disconnected from your actual product."

- [ ] **Implement Provider Abstraction Layer**
  - Create unified interface for all LLM providers
  - Handle provider-specific quirks (different APIs, formats)
  - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Add rate limiting and quota management
  - Track costs per provider
  
  **Provider Interface Pattern:**
  ```python
  class LLMProvider(ABC):
      @abstractmethod
      async def generate(self, prompt, config) -> Response:
          pass
      
      @abstractmethod
      def get_cost(self, tokens, model) -> float:
          pass
  
  # Concrete implementations
  class OpenAIProvider(LLMProvider):
      # Handles OpenAI-specific API
  
  class AnthropicProvider(LLMProvider):
      # Handles Anthropic-specific API
  
  # Factory pattern
  provider = ProviderFactory.get("openai")
  response = await provider.generate(prompt, config)
  ```
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Leaky abstraction**: Provider details bleeding through
  - **No error handling**: Crashes on rate limits/API errors
  - **Ignoring costs**: Not tracking spend, surprise bills
  - **Hard-coded credentials**: API keys in code (use env vars!)
  - **No retries**: Transient failures kill eval runs
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Use exponential backoff for retries: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s
  - Log raw API responses for debugging
  - Cache provider pricing (update monthly)
  - Set spending limits/alerts to avoid runaway costs
  - Test error paths: what happens when API is down?

- [ ] **Build Evaluation Executor**
  - Implement eval loop (load tasks ‚Üí run models ‚Üí evaluate ‚Üí save results)
  - Add parallel execution (respecting rate limits)
  - Implement caching (avoid re-running identical evals)
  - Create progress tracking (show eval status in real-time)
  - Handle failures gracefully (retry failures, don't crash whole batch)
  
  **Executor Pattern:**
  ```python
  class EvalExecutor:
      async def run_eval_batch(self, tasks, models):
          for task in tasks:
              for model in models:
                  # Check cache first
                  if cached := self.cache.get(task, model):
                      results.append(cached)
                      continue
                  
                  try:
                      # Run eval
                      response = await provider.generate(task.input)
                      result = self.evaluate(response, task.expected)
                      self.db.save(result)
                      self.cache.set(task, model, result)
                  except Exception as e:
                      # Log but continue with other evals
                      logger.error(f"Eval failed: {e}")
          
          return results
  ```
  
  **Caching Strategy:**
  - Cache key: hash(task_id + task_version + model + prompt_version + config)
  - Invalidate on: new task version, new prompt version, manual clear
  - Store in: Redis for shared cache, or in-memory for single process
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **No caching**: Re-running expensive evals unnecessarily
  - **Bad cache keys**: Cache collisions or misses
  - **Serial execution**: Running evals one-by-one (slow!)
  - **No progress tracking**: Users don't know if it's working
  - **Failing fast**: One error crashes entire batch
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Cache aggressively (LLM responses are expensive!)
  - Use async/await for parallel execution
  - Show progress: "Running eval 47/200 (23%)"
  - Collect all results, report failures at end
  - Set timeouts: don't wait forever for hanging requests

- [ ] **Implement Prompt Versioning System**
  - Store prompts in code (version controlled, not in database!)
  - Use templating for prompt variations
  - Track which prompt version was used for each eval
  - Make prompts easy to update (hot reload in dev)
  
  **Prompt Management (Hamel's Way):**
  ```python
  # prompts/v1_system_prompt.txt
  """You are a helpful assistant..."""
  
  # prompts/__init__.py
  class PromptLibrary:
      @staticmethod
      def get_prompt(name: str, version: str) -> str:
          path = PROMPTS_DIR / f"{version}_{name}.txt"
          return path.read_text().strip()
  
  # Usage
  system_prompt = PromptLibrary.get_prompt("system_prompt", "v1")
  ```
  
  **Why in code, not database:**
  - ‚úÖ Version control with git (automatic history)
  - ‚úÖ Code review for prompt changes
  - ‚úÖ Easy to diff versions
  - ‚úÖ Prompts deploy with code
  - ‚ùå Database = disconnected, hard to review, no history
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Prompts in database**: Hard to version, review, track
  - **No version tracking**: Don't know which prompt produced which results
  - **String concatenation**: Building prompts with f-strings
  - **One giant prompt**: Not modular, hard to A/B test
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Use git for versioning (automatic history, diffs, rollback)
  - Store as .txt/.md files (easy to read and edit)
  - Use templates for variables (Jinja2)
  - Tag prompts when deploying: `git tag prompt-v1.2`

**Red Flags in Phase 1:**
- üö® Provider abstraction leaks implementation details
- üö® No caching (wasting money on duplicate runs)
- üö® Prompts stored in database (hard to version)
- üö® Serial execution only (evals take hours)
- üö® No error handling (one failure crashes everything)
- üö® No cost tracking (surprise bills)

### Phase 2: Integration - Connect to Development Workflow
**Purpose**: Make evals part of daily development, not a separate process that gets skipped.

**Hamel's Key Insight**: "Evals must run automatically in CI/CD or they won't run at all. Make running evals easier than skipping them."

- [ ] **Implement CI/CD Integration**
  - Run core evals on every PR/commit
  - Block merges if critical evals fail
  - Show eval results in PR comments
  - Keep eval runs fast (<5 min for CI)
  
  **GitHub Actions Pattern:**
  ```yaml
  # .github/workflows/evals.yml
  name: Run Evals
  on:
    pull_request:
      branches: [main]
  jobs:
    run-evals:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - name: Run critical evals
          run: |
            python run_evals.py --suite critical --max-time 300
        - name: Post results to PR
          run: |
            # Post pass/fail summary as PR comment
        - name: Fail if critical evals fail
          run: |
            if [ $CRITICAL_FAILURES -gt 0 ]; then exit 1; fi
  ```
  
  **Eval Suite Organization:**
  - **CRITICAL**: Fast (<5min), must-pass, runs on every commit
  - **REGRESSION**: Broader set, runs nightly
  - **COMPREHENSIVE**: Full suite, runs weekly or before releases
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Slow CI evals**: >10min runs that developers skip
  - **No auto-run**: Relying on developers to remember
  - **All-or-nothing**: Either run all (slow) or none
  - **No failure blocking**: Evals fail but PR merges anyway
  - **No visibility**: Results buried in logs
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Keep CI evals under 5 minutes
  - Run comprehensive evals nightly, not on every commit
  - Show results prominently in PR comments
  - Allow "override" for non-critical failures
  - Cache between CI runs

- [ ] **Build Results Dashboard**
  - Show eval results over time (track improvements/regressions)
  - Enable filtering by tags, models, time ranges
  - Visualize pass/fail rates, latency, costs
  - Export results for deeper analysis
  
  **Key Dashboard Views:**
  1. **Overview**: Total evals, pass rate (with trend ‚Üë‚Üì), total cost, critical failures
  2. **Model Comparison**: Table of models with metrics, sortable by accuracy/cost/latency
  3. **Time Series**: Chart showing pass rate over time, annotated with version changes
  4. **Task Breakdown**: Which tasks passing/failing, expensive, slow
  5. **Detailed Results**: Drill into individual runs, see input/output, re-run evals
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Too much data**: Overwhelming dashboards no one uses
  - **No trends**: Only current state, missing regressions
  - **Can't drill down**: Summary only, can't investigate
  - **No exports**: Data locked in UI
  - **Stale data**: Not updating in real-time
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Start simple (tables first, charts only if needed)
  - Make regressions highly visible (red alerts)
  - Link to details: click pass rate ‚Üí see failed evals
  - Add "compare runs" feature for before/after
  - Export to CSV/JSON for custom analysis

- [ ] **Create Command-Line Interface**
  - Easy commands for common operations
  - Interactive mode for exploration
  - Scriptable for automation
  
  **CLI Commands:**
  ```bash
  # Run evals
  eval run --suite critical
  eval run --filter "tag:safety"
  
  # View results
  eval results --run latest
  eval compare run_1 run_2
  
  # Manage tasks
  eval tasks list
  eval tasks add --from-file tasks.json
  
  # Utilities
  eval cache clear
  eval costs --timeframe week
  ```
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Complex syntax**: Hard to remember commands
  - **No help text**: Users get stuck
  - **Not scriptable**: Can't automate with CLI
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Follow Unix conventions (--help, exit codes)
  - Provide both short (-f) and long (--filter) flags
  - Support JSON output for piping to other tools
  - Add interactive mode for exploration

**Red Flags in Phase 2:**
- üö® Evals don't run in CI (will be skipped)
- üö® CI evals take >10 minutes (too slow)
- üö® No dashboard or visibility (can't track progress)
- üö® No way to re-run failed evals (painful debugging)
- üö® Results not exportable (locked in platform)

### Phase 3: Optimization - Make It Fast and Cheap
**Purpose**: Once basics work, optimize for speed and cost efficiency.

- [ ] **Implement Smart Caching**
  - Cache identical prompts + model configs
  - Invalidate cache on version changes
  - Use Redis/Memcached for shared cache
  - Set TTL to prevent stale cache
  
  **Caching Wins:**
  - Avoid re-running identical evals (100% time + cost savings)
  - Share cache across team (deduplication)
  - Resume failed eval runs without re-running successes
  
  **Cache Invalidation Strategy:**
  - Clear on: new eval dataset version, new prompt version, new model version
  - Keep for: 30 days (configurable)
  - Manual clear: when debugging or suspect cache corruption

- [ ] **Optimize Parallel Execution**
  - Batch API requests where possible
  - Respect rate limits per provider
  - Use async/await for I/O concurrency
  - Monitor for bottlenecks
  
  **Parallelization Pattern:**
  ```python
  # Serial: N * avg_latency
  for task in tasks:
      result = await run_eval(task)
  
  # Parallel with rate limiting: N * avg_latency / concurrency
  semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(10)  # Max 10 concurrent
  async def run_with_limit(task):
      async with semaphore:
          return await run_eval(task)
  results = await asyncio.gather(*[run_with_limit(t) for t in tasks])
  ```

- [ ] **Track and Optimize Costs**
  - Monitor spend by model, task, user
  - Set budget alerts ($X/day, $Y/month)
  - Optimize prompts for token efficiency
  - Use cheaper models for simple evals
  
  **Cost Optimization Strategies:**
  - Use GPT-3.5 for format checks (10x cheaper than GPT-4)
  - Shorter prompts where possible (less tokens)
  - Cache aggressively (eliminate duplicate costs)
  - Use local models for development/testing
  - Track cost per eval, identify expensive tasks

**Red Flags in Phase 3:**
- üö® No caching (running same evals repeatedly)
- üö® Serial execution (10x slower than necessary)
- üö® No cost tracking (surprise bills)
- üö® Using GPT-4 for everything (expensive overkill)
- üö® No performance monitoring (don't know bottlenecks)

### Phase 4: Reliability - Production-Grade Infrastructure
**Purpose**: Make the platform reliable enough to depend on for critical decisions.

- [ ] **Implement Comprehensive Monitoring**
  - Track eval success/failure rates
  - Monitor API latencies and errors
  - Alert on anomalies (cost spike, high failure rate)
  - Log all eval runs for audit trail
  
  **Key Metrics:**
  - `eval_runs_total` (counter)
  - `eval_duration_seconds` (histogram)
  - `eval_failures_total` (counter by error_type)
  - `api_latency_seconds` (histogram by provider)
  - `api_cost_usd` (counter by provider/model)
  - `cache_hit_rate` (gauge)
  
  **Alerts:**
  - Eval failure rate >10% for 1 hour
  - API cost >$100/day
  - Eval latency p95 >30s
  - Cache hit rate <50%

- [ ] **Build Robust Error Handling**
  - Retry transient failures (with exponential backoff)
  - Circuit breaker for failing providers
  - Graceful degradation (fall back to cached results)
  - Detailed error reporting (don't swallow errors)
  
  **Error Categories:**
  - **Transient**: Rate limits, timeouts ‚Üí RETRY
  - **Permanent**: Invalid API key, bad request ‚Üí FAIL FAST
  - **Provider down**: All requests failing ‚Üí CIRCUIT BREAKER
  - **Partial failure**: Some evals fail ‚Üí LOG and CONTINUE

- [ ] **Ensure Data Integrity**
  - Validate inputs before running evals
  - Atomic transactions for result writes
  - Backup eval results regularly
  - Test disaster recovery
  
  **Data Integrity Checklist:**
  - [ ] Database backups daily
  - [ ] Point-in-time recovery enabled
  - [ ] Tested restore procedure
  - [ ] Audit log of all changes
  - [ ] Validation on all inputs

**Red Flags in Phase 4:**
- üö® No monitoring (flying blind)
- üö® No retries (transient failures kill evals)
- üö® No backups (risk of losing eval history)
- üö® No alerting (don't know when things break)
- üö® Errors swallowed silently (hide problems)

### Meta-Checklist: How to Use This Rubric

- **For New Platforms**: Work through Phases 0‚Üí1‚Üí2‚Üí3‚Üí4 in order. Don't skip.
- **For Existing Platforms**: Audit against each phase, identify gaps.
- **For Iteration**: Focus on Phases 1-2 initially, add 3-4 as needed.
- **Frequency**:
  - Phase 0: Before starting (requirements gathering)
  - Phases 1-2: Initial implementation (MVP)
  - Phase 3: Once you have real usage (optimize)
  - Phase 4: Before production reliance (harden)

**Remember**: Start simple. The best eval platform is one that actually gets used. Build the minimum viable platform first, then iterate based on real usage patterns. Don't build features users don't need. Don't optimize before you have performance problems. Don't add complexity until simplicity breaks down.

**Success = Platform that:**
- ‚úÖ Runs evals automatically (CI/CD integrated)
- ‚úÖ Runs fast enough not to block development (<5min)
- ‚úÖ Makes results visible and actionable
- ‚úÖ Costs are tracked and reasonable
- ‚úÖ Developers actually use it (not a barrier)
