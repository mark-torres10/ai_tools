## Performance Analysis Rubric Checklist

**CRITICAL**: This rubric complements @ai_evals_methodology_expert.md (designs evals), @evaluation_dashboard_expert.md (shows results), and @evaluation_data_management_expert.md (stores data). Focus on INTERPRETING results to drive decisions.

**Core Principle**: "Numbers without context are meaningless. Your job is to turn data into decisions."

### Phase 0: Foundation - Frame the Analysis Question
**Purpose**: Define what you're trying to learn from the data. Bad questions lead to meaningless analysis.

- [ ] **Define Analysis Objectives**
  - What decision will this analysis inform?
  - Who needs this information? (engineers? PMs? leadership?)
  - What would change based on results?
  - Success criteria: what makes Model A "better" than Model B?
  
  **Good Analysis Questions:**
  - ✅ "Should we switch from GPT-4 to Claude-3 for customer support?" (actionable decision)
  - ✅ "Which error types are most common in math tasks?" (guides improvement)
  - ✅ "Is the new prompt version significantly better?" (A/B test)
  - ❌ "How are models performing?" (too vague, no decision point)
  - ❌ "What's the accuracy?" (number without context)
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Analysis without purpose**: Analyzing because data exists
  - **Wrong question**: Answering "which is faster?" when you care about "which is better?"
  - **Unmeasurable objectives**: "Make users happier" (need proxy metrics)
  - **Moving goalposts**: Changing question after seeing results (p-hacking)
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Start with decision: "If X is true, we do Y"
  - Work backward to metrics needed
  - Define success criteria BEFORE seeing results
  - Align with @ai_evals_methodology_expert on metrics

- [ ] **Establish Baselines**
  - What are we comparing against?
  - Previous model version? Competitor? Random baseline?
  - Document baseline performance and why it's chosen
  - Ensure baseline is fair comparison
  
  **Baseline Examples:**
  - ✅ GOOD: "GPT-4 current performance (last 30 days avg)"
  - ✅ GOOD: "Random guessing (25% for 4-class problem)"
  - ✅ GOOD: "Human expert performance (90% accuracy)"
  - ❌ BAD: "Best model ever tested" (cherry-picked, unrealistic)
  - ❌ BAD: No baseline (can't tell if 85% is good or bad)
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Multiple baselines: previous version + random + human
  - Document why baseline was chosen
  - Re-establish baselines as system evolves

**Red Flags in Phase 0:**
- 🚨 Can't explain what decision analysis will inform
- 🚨 No baseline for comparison
- 🚨 Success criteria defined after seeing results
- 🚨 Analysis question too vague to answer

### Phase 1: Descriptive Analysis - Understand What Happened
**Purpose**: Summarize the data before jumping to conclusions. Understand the distribution, not just the average.

- [ ] **Calculate Summary Statistics**
  - Mean, median, std dev for key metrics
  - Min, max, percentiles (p25, p50, p75, p95, p99)
  - Sample size (crucial for significance!)
  - Distribution shape (normal? skewed? bimodal?)
  
  **Summary Table Example:**
  ```
  Model      | n   | Pass Rate | Latency p50 | Latency p95 | Cost
  -----------|-----|-----------|-------------|-------------|------
  GPT-4      | 500 | 85% ±2%   | 1.2s        | 3.5s        | $0.12
  Claude-3   | 500 | 82% ±2%   | 0.8s        | 2.1s        | $0.08
  GPT-3.5    | 500 | 78% ±3%   | 0.5s        | 1.2s        | $0.02
  ```
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Only reporting mean**: Hides distribution shape
  - **Ignoring sample size**: 90% from 10 samples ≠ 90% from 1000
  - **Missing percentiles**: p95 latency matters more than average
  - **No uncertainty**: "85%" without confidence interval
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Always report: n (sample size) + mean ± CI or std dev
  - Use median for skewed distributions (latency, cost)
  - Report p95/p99 for tail behavior (worst cases)
  - Visualize distributions (histograms, box plots)

- [ ] **Segment Analysis**
  - Break down by category (task type, difficulty, tags)
  - Identify where models excel vs. struggle
  - Find interaction effects (model A good at X, bad at Y)
  - Prioritize high-impact segments
  
  **Segmentation Examples:**
  - ✅ "GPT-4: 95% on math, 75% on creative writing" (reveals strength/weakness)
  - ✅ "Claude-3: Better on long-context tasks (>2K tokens)"
  - ❌ "Overall accuracy: 85%" (hides important patterns)
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Only aggregate metrics**: Missing segment patterns
  - **Too many segments**: 50 slices, can't see pattern
  - **Cherry-picking**: Only showing favorable segments
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Start with 3-5 key segments (task type, difficulty)
  - Look for largest differences between segments
  - Weight by volume: 1% of tasks aren't worth optimizing

- [ ] **Error Analysis**
  - Review failure cases systematically (align with @ai_evals_methodology_expert Phase 0)
  - Categorize error types (hallucination, refusal, format, etc.)
  - Quantify error frequency and severity
  - Identify patterns: specific task types? edge cases?
  
  **Error Analysis Pattern:**
  ```
  Error Type        | Count | % of Failures | Severity
  ------------------|-------|---------------|----------
  Hallucination     | 45    | 30%           | HIGH
  Format violation  | 38    | 25%           | MEDIUM
  Refusal (valid Q) | 25    | 17%           | MEDIUM
  Incorrect answer  | 42    | 28%           | HIGH
  ```
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Prioritize by: frequency × severity × fixability
  - Link back to eval design (do evals cover this?)
  - Sample failed cases: review 20-50 manually

**Red Flags in Phase 1:**
- 🚨 Only reporting aggregate metrics (hiding patterns)
- 🚨 No sample sizes reported (can't assess significance)
- 🚨 No error analysis (don't understand failures)
- 🚨 Skipping visualization (harder to spot patterns)

### Phase 2: Comparative Analysis - Is the Difference Real?
**Purpose**: Determine if observed differences are statistically significant or just noise.

- [ ] **Test Statistical Significance**
  - Choose appropriate test (t-test, chi-square, etc.)
  - Check assumptions (normality, independence)
  - Calculate p-value AND effect size
  - Interpret correctly (statistical vs. practical significance)
  
  **Statistical Testing Guide:**
  ```
  Comparing pass rates (binary):
  → Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test
  → Report: χ²(1) = 5.2, p = 0.023, effect size = 0.10
  
  Comparing latencies (continuous):
  → Mann-Whitney U test (non-normal) or t-test (normal)
  → Report: U = 4521, p = 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.45
  ```
  
  **Significance Thresholds:**
  - p < 0.05: Statistically significant (conventional)
  - p < 0.01: Highly significant
  - p < 0.001: Very highly significant
  - **BUT**: Always check effect size! Small differences can be significant with large n.
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **P-hacking**: Testing many comparisons until one is significant
  - **Ignoring effect size**: p=0.001 but difference is tiny
  - **Wrong test**: Using t-test on non-normal data
  - **Multiple comparisons**: No correction (inflated false positives)
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Use Bonferroni correction for multiple tests
  - Report both p-value AND effect size
  - Check test assumptions (normality, variance homogeneity)
  - Practical significance > statistical significance

- [ ] **Calculate Confidence Intervals**
  - 95% CI for all key metrics
  - Visualize overlapping vs. non-overlapping CIs
  - Interpret: "We're 95% confident true pass rate is 83-87%"
  
  **CI Interpretation:**
  - ✅ "Model A: 85% ± 2% (CI: 83-87%)" (clear uncertainty)
  - ✅ "CIs don't overlap → likely real difference"
  - ❌ "Model A: 85%" (no uncertainty, misleading)

- [ ] **Assess Practical Significance**
  - Is the difference large enough to matter?
  - Consider cost, latency, accuracy trade-offs
  - Consult stakeholders on acceptable thresholds
  
  **Practical Significance Examples:**
  - ✅ "3% better accuracy, 2x slower, 5x more expensive → not worth it"
  - ✅ "1% better accuracy on safety tasks → worth it (high stakes)"
  - ❌ "Statistically significant (p=0.01) but 0.1% improvement → who cares?"

**Red Flags in Phase 2:**
- 🚨 No statistical testing (assuming difference is real)
- 🚨 P-value without effect size
- 🚨 Claiming significance with n<30 per group
- 🚨 Multiple comparisons without correction
- 🚨 Ignoring practical significance

### Phase 3: Insights & Recommendations - Turn Data into Decisions
**Purpose**: Translate statistical analysis into actionable recommendations.

- [ ] **Synthesize Key Findings**
  - What are top 3-5 insights?
  - Which findings are most actionable?
  - What's surprising or unexpected?
  - What hypotheses were confirmed/rejected?
  
  **Good Insights:**
  - ✅ "Claude-3 is 10% cheaper and 2% less accurate → good for low-stakes tasks"
  - ✅ "GPT-4 fails 30% of math tasks due to calculation errors → need tool use"
  - ❌ "Model performed well" (vague, not actionable)

- [ ] **Make Recommendations**
  - Prioritize by impact and feasibility
  - Link recommendations to findings
  - Include trade-offs and risks
  - Provide clear next steps
  
  **Recommendation Framework:**
  ```
  1. IMMEDIATE: Switch to Claude-3 for summarization tasks
     - Why: 15% cost savings, equivalent accuracy
     - Risk: Slight latency increase (acceptable)
     - Action: Deploy to 10% traffic, monitor for 1 week
  
  2. SHORT-TERM: Add calculator tool for GPT-4 math tasks
     - Why: 30% of failures are calculation errors
     - Impact: +10% accuracy on math tasks
     - Action: Implement tool calling, re-eval
  ```
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Recommendations should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
  - Include expected impact ("will improve X by Y%")
  - Acknowledge uncertainties and risks
  - Prioritize: quick wins + high-impact changes

- [ ] **Create Visualizations**
  - Charts that tell the story (not just data dumps)
  - Annotate important findings
  - Use consistent color coding
  - Make accessible (color-blind friendly, labeled axes)
  
  **Effective Visualizations:**
  - Comparison bar chart: models side-by-side on key metrics
  - Time series: performance trend over time (spot regressions)
  - Error breakdown: pie/bar chart of error categories
  - Scatter plot: accuracy vs. cost (find efficient frontier)

**Red Flags in Phase 3:**
- 🚨 Analysis without recommendations (so what?)
- 🚨 Vague recommendations ("improve model")
- 🚨 Recommendations without supporting data
- 🚨 No prioritization (everything is "high priority")

### Phase 4: Communication & Reproducibility
**Purpose**: Ensure analysis is understood, trusted, and can be reproduced.

- [ ] **Write Clear Reports**
  - Executive summary (1 paragraph for leadership)
  - Key findings (bullets, not walls of text)
  - Detailed analysis (for technical audience)
  - Appendix (methodology, all tables/charts)
  
  **Report Structure:**
  ```
  1. Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)
  2. Recommendations (3-5 prioritized actions)
  3. Key Findings (5-7 bullets with supporting data)
  4. Detailed Analysis (charts, tables, statistics)
  5. Methodology (how analysis was done)
  6. Appendix (full results, assumptions, limitations)
  ```

- [ ] **Make Analysis Reproducible**
  - Version control analysis code (Jupyter notebooks in git)
  - Document data sources and versions
  - Pin library versions (requirements.txt)
  - Include instructions to re-run
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Use notebooks for exploration, scripts for production
  - Add narrative text explaining each step
  - Save intermediate results for debugging
  - Test reproducibility: can someone else run it?

- [ ] **Communicate Uncertainty**
  - Always include confidence intervals
  - Acknowledge limitations and assumptions
  - Highlight where more data is needed
  - Don't overstate conclusions
  
  **Honest Communication:**
  - ✅ "Based on 500 samples, we're 95% confident pass rate is 83-87%"
  - ✅ "Limited data on edge cases - need more evaluation"
  - ❌ "Pass rate is exactly 85.3%" (false precision)

**Red Flags in Phase 4:**
- 🚨 Can't reproduce analysis from 2 weeks ago
- 🚨 No documentation of methodology
- 🚨 Presenting results without uncertainty
- 🚨 One report for all audiences (too technical or too simple)

### Meta-Checklist: How to Use This Rubric

- **For New Analysis**: Phase 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 in order
- **For Ongoing Monitoring**: Phase 1 (weekly), Phase 2-3 (as needed)
- **Time Allocation**:
  - Phase 0: 1 day (frame question, baselines)
