## Data Management Rubric Checklist

**CRITICAL**: This rubric complements @llm_evaluation_platform_architect.md (builds the platform) and @evaluation_dashboard_expert.md (displays the data). Focus on HOW data is stored, versioned, and queried - the foundation everything else builds on.

**Core Principle**: "Good data architecture is invisible. Users shouldn't think about the database - it should just work, fast."

### Phase 0: Foundation - Understand Data Requirements
**Purpose**: Design the right data model by understanding what questions users need to answer and how data will grow.

- [ ] **Map Query Patterns**
  - Document top 10 most common queries users will run
  - Identify filters used most often (by model? by tag? by date?)
  - Understand reporting needs (daily summaries? model comparisons?)
  - Plan for growth: 100 evals/day? 10,000/day?
  
  **Query Pattern Examples:**
  - ✅ GOOD: "Show me all failures for GPT-4 in last 7 days, grouped by task category"
  - ✅ GOOD: "Compare pass rates across models for tasks tagged 'safety'"
  - ✅ GOOD: "Export all eval results for run_id X with full model outputs"
  - ❌ BAD: "We need to query everything" (too vague, can't optimize)
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Designing without queries**: Building schema before knowing how it's used
  - **Optimizing for wrong patterns**: Optimizing rare queries, slowing common ones
  - **Ignoring growth**: Not planning for 10x or 100x data volume
  - **Missing reporting needs**: Dashboard queries not considered in design
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Shadow @evaluation_dashboard_expert: what queries does UI need?
  - Look at @ai_evals_methodology_expert: what metrics matter?
  - Start with top 5 queries, optimize for those first
  - Measure actual query patterns in production, iterate

- [ ] **Define Data Retention Policy**
  - How long to keep eval results? (30 days? 1 year? forever?)
  - What to archive vs. delete? (keep summaries, delete raw outputs?)
  - Compliance requirements? (GDPR, data privacy)
  - Storage budget constraints?
  
  **Retention Strategy Examples:**
  - ✅ GOOD: "Keep detailed results 90 days, summaries 1 year, aggregates forever"
  - ✅ GOOD: "Archive runs >30 days old to cold storage (cheaper, slower)"
  - ❌ BAD: "Keep everything forever" (storage costs explode)
  - ❌ BAD: "Delete after 7 days" (can't debug regressions)
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **No retention policy**: Database grows indefinitely
  - **Deleting too aggressively**: Lose ability to debug past issues
  - **Keeping everything**: Storage costs exceed value
  - **No archival strategy**: Hot database full of cold data (slow queries)
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Separate hot (recent, fast) vs. cold (old, archived) storage
  - Keep aggregates/summaries forever, raw data temporarily
  - Automate archival: move data >90 days to cheaper storage
  - Track storage costs: alert when growing too fast

**Red Flags in Phase 0:**
- 🚨 Designing schema without knowing query patterns
- 🚨 No retention policy (database will grow forever)
- 🚨 Not planning for data growth (will hit limits)
- 🚨 Ignoring dashboard/reporting needs (slow queries later)

### Phase 1: Schema Design - Build for Queries, Not Just Storage
**Purpose**: Design a database schema that makes common queries fast and supports versioning from day 1.

- [ ] **Design Core Tables**
  - Start simple: Tasks, Models, Results (3 core tables)
  - Add versioning columns to EVERYTHING (critical!)
  - Use appropriate data types (don't store JSON as text)
  - Plan indexes from the start (based on Phase 0 query patterns)
  
  **Minimal Schema (Start Here):**
  ```sql
  -- Tasks table
  CREATE TABLE eval_tasks (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    version VARCHAR NOT NULL,  -- "v1.0", "v1.1"
    name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    input JSONB NOT NULL,
    expected_output JSONB,
    metadata JSONB,  -- tags, category, difficulty
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    created_by VARCHAR
  );
  
  -- Index for common queries
  CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_version ON eval_tasks(version);
  CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_metadata ON eval_tasks USING GIN(metadata);
  
  -- Results table
  CREATE TABLE eval_results (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    task_id UUID REFERENCES eval_tasks(id),
    model_provider VARCHAR NOT NULL,  -- "openai", "anthropic"
    model_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,      -- "gpt-4", "claude-3"
    model_version VARCHAR,             -- Specific snapshot
    prompt_version VARCHAR NOT NULL,   -- Which prompt was used
    passed BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    score FLOAT,
    model_output TEXT,
    latency_ms INTEGER,
    cost_usd DECIMAL(10,6),
    evaluated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
  );
  
  -- Indexes for dashboard queries
  CREATE INDEX idx_results_task ON eval_results(task_id);
  CREATE INDEX idx_results_model ON eval_results(model_name);
  CREATE INDEX idx_results_date ON eval_results(evaluated_at DESC);
  CREATE INDEX idx_results_passed ON eval_results(passed);
  ```
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **No versioning**: Can't reproduce results from last month
  - **Missing indexes**: Queries take minutes instead of seconds
  - **Wrong data types**: Storing JSONB as TEXT (can't query efficiently)
  - **Over-normalization**: 20 tables for simple data (complex joins)
  - **Under-normalization**: Duplicate data everywhere (inconsistency)
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Use JSONB for flexible metadata (tags, custom fields)
  - Always add created_at timestamps
  - Use UUIDs for IDs (easier distribution/merging)
  - Start with few tables, add more only when needed

- [ ] **Implement Data Validation**
  - Add database constraints (NOT NULL, CHECK constraints)
  - Validate data at write time (catch errors early)
  - Use application-level validation too (Pydantic, Zod)
  - Document validation rules
  
  **Validation Examples:**
  ```sql
  -- Ensure scores are 0-100%
  ALTER TABLE eval_results 
  ADD CONSTRAINT score_range CHECK (score >= 0 AND score <= 100);
  
  -- Ensure timestamps are reasonable
  ALTER TABLE eval_results
  ADD CONSTRAINT reasonable_date CHECK (evaluated_at > '2024-01-01');
  
  -- Ensure cost is non-negative
  ALTER TABLE eval_results
  ADD CONSTRAINT positive_cost CHECK (cost_usd >= 0);
  ```
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **No constraints**: Bad data silently inserted
  - **Too strict constraints**: Legitimate data rejected
  - **Only app validation**: Database bypassed, bad data inserted
  - **No documentation**: Don't know what's valid
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Use database constraints for critical invariants
  - Use app validation for complex business logic
  - Log validation failures for debugging
  - Make constraints explicit in schema documentation

- [ ] **Set Up Versioning Strategy**
  - Version EVERYTHING: tasks, prompts, models, eval datasets
  - Use semantic versioning where appropriate
  - Never modify existing records, create new versions
  - Track version lineage (which version came from which)
  
  **Versioning Pattern:**
  ```sql
  -- Task versioning
  INSERT INTO eval_tasks (version, name, input, ...)
  VALUES ('v1.1', 'math_addition', '{"a": 5, "b": 3}', ...);
  
  -- Results reference specific versions
  INSERT INTO eval_results (
    task_id,
    task_version,  -- Snapshot which version was used
    model_version,
    prompt_version,
    ...
  );
  ```
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Updating in place**: Loses history, can't reproduce
  - **No version tracking**: Don't know which version was used
  - **Complex versioning**: Tree of versions (confusing)
  - **Version sprawl**: Too many versions (hard to manage)
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Use simple sequential versions: v1, v2, v3
  - Store version in results (immutable snapshot)
  - Add version to all SELECT queries
  - Archive old versions but keep accessible

**Red Flags in Phase 1:**
- 🚨 No indexes on commonly queried columns
- 🚨 No data validation or constraints
- 🚨 No versioning strategy
- 🚨 Schema doesn't match query patterns from Phase 0
- 🚨 Using wrong database (e.g., MongoDB for tabular data)

### Phase 2: Query Optimization - Make Queries Fast
**Purpose**: Optimize database performance so dashboards load quickly and analytics don't time out.

- [ ] **Optimize Common Queries**
  - Profile slow queries (>100ms is slow for simple queries)
  - Add indexes for frequent filters (model, date, status)
  - Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to understand query plans
  - Consider materialized views for complex aggregations
  
  **Optimization Examples:**
  - ✅ Create index on (model_name, evaluated_at) for model timeline queries
  - ✅ Use materialized view for daily/weekly aggregates (pre-computed)
  - ✅ Partition results table by date (faster date range queries)
  - ❌ Creating indexes on every column (wastes space, slows writes)

- [ ] **Implement Caching Strategy**
  - Cache expensive queries (aggregations, comparisons)
  - Use Redis for frequently accessed data
  - Set appropriate TTLs (Time To Live)
  - Invalidate cache on data changes
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **No caching**: Same expensive query runs repeatedly
  - **Stale cache**: Showing old data, confusing users
  - **Over-caching**: Caching everything, memory bloat
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Cache read-heavy aggregations (pass rates, comparisons)
  - Set cache TTL: 5min for changing data, 1hr for stable
  - Invalidate on writes: clear cache when new results added

- [ ] **Monitor Query Performance**
  - Track slow queries (log queries >500ms)
  - Monitor index usage (unused indexes?)
  - Alert on performance degradation
  - Regular VACUUM and ANALYZE (PostgreSQL)
  
  **Metrics to Track:**
  - Query latency p50, p95, p99
  - Queries per second
  - Cache hit rate
  - Index scan vs. sequential scan ratio

**Red Flags in Phase 2:**
- 🚨 Queries taking >2 seconds regularly
- 🚨 No query monitoring or profiling
- 🚨 Indexes never analyzed or updated
- 🚨 Dashboard times out loading data

### Phase 3: Data Quality - Keep Data Clean
**Purpose**: Ensure data quality through validation, monitoring, and automated checks.

- [ ] **Automated Data Quality Checks**
  - Check for null values in required fields
  - Validate data ranges (scores 0-100%, positive costs)
  - Detect duplicates or inconsistencies
  - Alert on anomalies (sudden data changes)
  
  **Quality Check Examples:**
  ```sql
  -- Check for orphaned results (task deleted)
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM eval_results r
  LEFT JOIN eval_tasks t ON r.task_id = t.id
  WHERE t.id IS NULL;
  
  -- Check for suspicious scores
  SELECT * FROM eval_results
  WHERE score > 100 OR score < 0;
  ```

- [ ] **Data Lineage Tracking**
  - Track where data came from
  - Document transformations
  - Link results to exact eval run
  - Enable "how did we get this number?" queries

- [ ] **Backup and Recovery**
  - Daily automated backups
  - Test restore procedure (actually works?)
  - Point-in-time recovery enabled
  - Off-site backup storage
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **No backups**: One mistake deletes everything
  - **Untested backups**: Backups exist but don't restore
  - **No retention**: Old backups deleted, can't recover

**Red Flags in Phase 3:**
- 🚨 No data validation checks
- 🚨 Can't explain where data came from
- 🚨 No backup strategy or untested backups
- 🚨 Bad data discovered weeks later

### Phase 4: Scalability - Prepare for Growth
**Purpose**: Scale the database as evaluation volume grows 10x, 100x.

- [ ] **Plan for Scale**
  - Partition large tables (by date, model, etc.)
  - Consider read replicas for heavy read load
  - Archive old data to cold storage
  - Monitor and plan capacity
  
  **Scaling Strategies:**
  - **Horizontal**: Add read replicas
  - **Vertical**: Bigger database server
  - **Partitioning**: Split table into smaller chunks
  - **Archival**: Move old data to cheaper storage

- [ ] **Migration Strategy**
  - Use migration tools (Alembic, Flyway)
  - Version control all schema changes
  - Test migrations on staging first
  - Plan rollback procedures
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **No migrations**: Manual SQL changes (error-prone)
  - **Untested migrations**: Breaks production
  - **No rollback plan**: Can't undo bad migration

**Red Flags in Phase 4:**
- 🚨 Database at capacity limits
- 🚨 No migration management system
- 🚨 Queries slowing down as data grows
- 🚨 No archival or partitioning strategy

### Meta-Checklist: How to Use This Rubric

- **For New Systems**: Phase 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 in order
- **For Existing Systems**: Audit against each phase, fix gaps
- **Time Allocation**:
  - Phase 0: 2-3 days (requirements, planning)
  - Phase 1: 1 week (schema design)
  - Phase 2: Ongoing (optimize as needed)
  - Phase 3: 3-5 days (quality checks, backups)
  - Phase 4: As needed (when hitting limits)

**Success = Data system where:**
- ✅ Queries return in <500ms (dashboard feels instant)
- ✅ Can reproduce any eval result from 6 months ago
- ✅ Data quality issues caught automatically
- ✅ Handles 10x data growth without redesign
- ✅ Backups tested and working
