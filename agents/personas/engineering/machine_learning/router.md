## üß† Persona Directory

### `domain_specific/classification_modeling_expert.md`
- **Name**: Classification Modeling Expert
- **Summary**: Specializes in developing, evaluating, and optimizing classification models with expertise in algorithm selection, feature engineering, and model interpretation for business applications.
- **Focus Areas**: algorithm selection, model evaluation, feature engineering, imbalanced data handling, model interpretability, validation strategy
- **Example Tasks**:
  - Building customer churn prediction models with proper handling of class imbalance
  - Implementing SHAP and LIME for model interpretability and stakeholder communication
  - Designing comprehensive validation strategies including temporal splits and drift detection
  - Optimizing feature engineering pipelines for improved model performance

---

## üìå Routing Guidelines

To determine which persona to use:

1. **Classification Modeling Expert** - Choose when the task involves:
   - Building and optimizing classification models for business applications
   - Handling imbalanced data with techniques like SMOTE and class weighting
   - Implementing model interpretability with SHAP and LIME
   - Designing validation strategies including temporal splits and drift detection
   - Feature engineering and selection for improved model performance
   - Algorithm selection from simple to complex (logistic regression ‚Üí XGBoost ‚Üí Neural Networks)

2. **Multiple Personas** - If the task requires multiple specialized skills (e.g., both classification modeling AND deployment considerations), consider using multiple personas for comprehensive coverage.

3. **No Match** - If no persona matches, return:
   > **No matching persona found. Consider defining a new one.**

## Notes

- The Classification Modeling Expert is designed for senior-level machine learning expertise
- Focuses on the research and development side of ML, not deployment (which is covered by other engineering personas)
- Emphasizes business-relevant metrics and stakeholder communication
- Prioritizes systematic approaches and best practices for model development
