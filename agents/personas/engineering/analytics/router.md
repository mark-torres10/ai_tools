## üìå Routing Guidelines

To determine which persona to use:

### Use **Growth Engineer** when:
- ‚úÖ Designing or implementing A/B tests or experiments
- ‚úÖ Setting up feature flag infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Calculating statistical power or sample sizes
- ‚úÖ Debugging experiment data quality (SRM, instrumentation bugs)
- ‚úÖ Implementing randomization or variant assignment
- ‚úÖ Building experimentation platforms
- ‚úÖ Analyzing experiment results with statistical rigor
- ‚úÖ Technical implementation of tracking for experiments

### Use **Product Analyst** when:
- ‚úÖ Defining product metrics (engagement, retention, activation)
- ‚úÖ Choosing which metrics to track and why
- ‚úÖ Designing event tracking schemas and naming conventions
- ‚úÖ Building dashboards for product health monitoring
- ‚úÖ Analyzing user behavior patterns (funnels, cohorts, paths)
- ‚úÖ Extracting insights from analytics data
- ‚úÖ Communicating data-driven recommendations to stakeholders
- ‚úÖ Setting up product analytics infrastructure (PostHog, Amplitude)

### Use **Both** when:
- ‚úÖ Launching new features with tracking + experimentation
- ‚úÖ Setting up complete analytics + experimentation stack
- ‚úÖ Product Analyst defines metrics ‚Üí Growth Engineer implements experiment
- ‚úÖ Growth Engineer runs experiment ‚Üí Product Analyst analyzes broader impact

## üéØ Workflow: Analytics + Experimentation

For comprehensive analytics and experimentation setup:

**Phase 1: Metric Definition** (Product Analyst)
- Define North Star metric and key metrics
- Choose framework (HEART, AARRR)
- Define success criteria and guardrails

**Phase 2: Event Tracking** (Product Analyst)
- Design event taxonomy and naming convention
- Create tracking plan
- Implement schema validation

**Phase 3: Dashboard Setup** (Product Analyst)
- Build product health dashboards
- Set up funnels, retention, cohorts
- Configure automated alerts

**Phase 4: Experimentation** (Growth Engineer)
- Design A/B test methodology
- Calculate sample sizes and power
- Implement feature flags and randomization
- Set up SRM detection

**Phase 5: Analysis & Iteration** (Both)
- Product Analyst: Extract insights, segment analysis, storytelling
- Growth Engineer: Statistical analysis, experiment conclusions
- Both: Communicate findings, drive product decisions

## Notes

- Growth Engineer focuses on **technical implementation** and **statistical rigor** of experiments
- Product Analyst focuses on **metric definition** and **insight extraction**
- They work together: Product Analyst defines what to measure, Growth Engineer ensures it's measured trustworthily
- Both are essential for data-driven product development
