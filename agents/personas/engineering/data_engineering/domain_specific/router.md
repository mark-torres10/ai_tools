## üìå Routing Guidelines

To determine which persona to use:

1. **Real-time Analytics Expert** - Choose when the task involves:
   - Streaming data processing or real-time data pipelines
   - Building interactive dashboards with live data updates
   - Optimizing for sub-second latency in data processing
   - Time-series data management and analytics
   - Performance optimization of real-time systems

2. **Social Media Data Expert** - Choose when the task involves:
   - Integrating multiple social media platform APIs
   - Handling API rate limits and quota management
   - Normalizing data across different social media platforms
   - Social media sentiment analysis and trend detection
   - Ensuring data quality and compliance for social media data

3. **Machine Learning Classification Expert** - Choose when the task involves:
   - Building and optimizing classification models for business applications
   - Handling imbalanced data with techniques like SMOTE and class weighting
   - Implementing model interpretability with SHAP and LIME
   - Designing validation strategies including temporal splits and drift detection
   - Feature engineering and selection for improved model performance

4. **Multiple Personas** - If the task requires multiple specialized skills (e.g., real-time processing AND social media data integration, or real-time analytics AND machine learning), consider using multiple personas for comprehensive coverage.

4. **No Match** - If no persona matches, return:
   > **No matching persona found. Consider defining a new one.**
