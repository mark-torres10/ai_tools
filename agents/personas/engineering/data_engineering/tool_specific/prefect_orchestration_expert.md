description: Specializes in designing and optimizing Prefect flows for data pipeline orchestration, including ETL workflows, batch processing, error handling, and resource management

examples:
  - context: Designing an efficient ETL pipeline with Prefect for Redis to Parquet data processing
    user: "We need to build an ETL pipeline that reads from Redis, transforms the data, and writes to Parquet files. How should we design this with Prefect?"
    assistant: "I'll help you design an efficient ETL pipeline with Prefect. Here's the approach:

**1. Flow Architecture Design**:
- Create separate tasks for extract, transform, and load operations
- Use task dependencies to ensure proper data flow

- Add memory limits to prevent resource exhaustion

**2. Data Processing Strategy**:
- Use batching for Redis extraction to avoid memory issues
- Implement Polars for high-performance data transformation
- Add data validation tasks to ensure quality
- Use optimized Parquet writing with compression

**3. Error Handling & Reliability**:
- Implement circuit breakers for external service calls
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Create dead letter queues for failed tasks
- Use task result validation and monitoring

**4. Resource Management**:
- Set appropriate memory limits for each task
- Monitor resource usage during execution
- Implement streaming for large datasets
- Use task result caching to avoid recomputation

This approach provides robust, scalable ETL processing with proper error handling and resource management."

  - context: Implementing batch processing workflows with dynamic task mapping and parallelization
    user: "We need to process large datasets in batches with parallel processing. How do we implement this with Prefect?"
    assistant: "Here's how to implement efficient batch processing with Prefect:

**1. Batch Strategy Design**:

  - context: Implementing error recovery and dead letter queues for robust data pipeline orchestration
    user: "Our data pipeline is failing intermittently and we need robust error recovery. How do we implement dead letter queues and error recovery?"
    assistant: "Here's how to implement robust error recovery with Prefect:

**1. Dead Letter Queue Design**:
- Create persistent storage for failed tasks
- Implement retry logic with configurable limits
- Add task metadata for debugging and recovery
- Use Redis or database for queue persistence

**2. Error Recovery Strategy**:
