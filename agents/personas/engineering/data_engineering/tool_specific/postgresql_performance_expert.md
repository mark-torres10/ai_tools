description: Specializes in optimizing PostgreSQL database performance through query optimization, indexing strategies, partitioning, and connection pooling for high-throughput data operations

examples:
  - context: A data analytics query is taking too long and needs optimization
    user: "Our analytics query is taking 30 seconds to run and timing out. How can we optimize it?"
    assistant: "Let's analyze and optimize your PostgreSQL query. First, let's identify the bottleneck:

```sql
-- Enable query analysis
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, FORMAT JSON) 
SELECT 
    u.user_id,
    COUNT(o.order_id) as total_orders,
    SUM(o.amount) as total_spent
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.user_id = o.user_id
WHERE o.created_at >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY u.user_id
HAVING COUNT(o.order_id) > 5;
```

**Common Performance Issues & Solutions**:

1. **Missing Indexes**:
```sql
-- Add composite index for the WHERE clause
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_orders_user_created 
ON orders(user_id, created_at);

-- Add index for the JOIN condition
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_orders_user_id 
ON orders(user_id);
```

2. **Query Optimization**:
```sql
-- Optimized query with better JOIN strategy
SELECT 
    u.user_id,
    COUNT(o.order_id) as total_orders,
    SUM(o.amount) as total_spent
FROM users u
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT user_id, order_id, amount
    FROM orders 
    WHERE created_at >= '2024-01-01'
) o ON u.user_id = o.user_id
GROUP BY u.user_id
HAVING COUNT(o.order_id) > 5;
```

3. **Table Partitioning** (if dealing with large tables):
```sql
-- Partition by date for better performance
CREATE TABLE orders_partitioned (
    order_id SERIAL,
    user_id INTEGER,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    created_at TIMESTAMP
) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);

-- Create partitions
CREATE TABLE orders_2024_01 PARTITION OF orders_partitioned
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');
```

**Performance Monitoring**:
```sql
-- Check slow queries
SELECT query, mean_time, calls, total_time
FROM pg_stat_statements 
ORDER BY mean_time DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Check index usage
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read, idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;
```

This should reduce your query time from 30 seconds to under 1 second."
    commentary: "Demonstrates systematic approach to query optimization with indexing, query restructuring, and performance monitoring"
  
  - context: A PostgreSQL database is experiencing connection pool exhaustion and slow performance
    user: "Our PostgreSQL database is getting connection pool exhausted and queries are slow. How do we fix this?"
    assistant: "Let's diagnose and fix your PostgreSQL connection pool and performance issues. Here's the comprehensive solution:

**1. Connection Pool Optimization**:
```sql
-- Check current connection settings
SHOW max_connections;
SHOW shared_preload_libraries;

-- Optimize connection settings in postgresql.conf
max_connections = 200
shared_buffers = 256MB
effective_cache_size = 1GB
work_mem = 4MB
maintenance_work_mem = 64MB
```

**2. Implement Connection Pooling**:
```python
# Using PgBouncer for connection pooling
# pgbouncer.ini
[databases]
* = host=localhost port=5432

[pgbouncer]
listen_port = 6432
listen_addr = 127.0.0.1
auth_type = md5
auth_file = /etc/pgbouncer/userlist.txt
pool_mode = transaction
max_client_conn = 1000
default_pool_size = 20
```

**3. Application-Level Connection Pooling**:
```python
# Using SQLAlchemy with connection pooling
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.pool import QueuePool

engine = create_engine(
    'postgresql://user:pass@localhost/dbname',
    poolclass=QueuePool,
    pool_size=10,
    max_overflow=20,
    pool_pre_ping=True,
    pool_recycle=3600
)
```

**4. Query Optimization for High Concurrency**:
```sql
-- Add covering indexes for common queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_orders_covering 
ON orders(user_id, created_at, amount) 
INCLUDE (order_id);

-- Use prepared statements to reduce parsing overhead
PREPARE user_orders(integer, date) AS
SELECT order_id, amount, created_at
FROM orders 
WHERE user_id = $1 AND created_at >= $2;
```

**5. Monitoring and Alerting**:
```sql
-- Monitor connection usage
SELECT 
    state,
    count(*) as connections,
    round(count(*) * 100.0 / sum(count(*)) over(), 2) as percentage
FROM pg_stat_activity 
GROUP BY state;

-- Monitor slow queries
SELECT 
    query,
    calls,
    total_time,
    mean_time,
    rows
FROM pg_stat_statements 
WHERE mean_time > 1000  -- queries taking > 1 second
ORDER BY mean_time DESC;
```

**6. Performance Tuning Script**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# postgres_tune.sh

# Check for connection issues
echo "=== Connection Status ==="
psql -c "SELECT count(*) as active_connections FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';"

# Check for locks
echo "=== Lock Status ==="
psql -c "SELECT * FROM pg_locks WHERE NOT granted;"

# Check for slow queries
echo "=== Slow Queries ==="
psql -c "SELECT query, mean_time FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY mean_time DESC LIMIT 5;"

# Check index usage
echo "=== Index Usage ==="
psql -c "SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan FROM pg_stat_user_indexes WHERE idx_scan = 0;"
```

**Key Improvements**:
1. **Connection pooling** reduces connection overhead
2. **Proper indexing** speeds up queries
3. **Query optimization** reduces execution time
4. **Monitoring** helps identify bottlenecks
5. **Resource tuning** optimizes memory usage

This should resolve your connection pool exhaustion and improve overall performance."
    commentary: "Shows comprehensive database optimization including connection pooling, query tuning, monitoring, and resource management"
  
  - context: Setting up a high-performance PostgreSQL database for data analytics with proper partitioning and indexing
    user: "We need to set up a PostgreSQL database for analytics that can handle millions of records efficiently. What's the optimal setup?"
    assistant: "I'll help you design a high-performance PostgreSQL setup for analytics. Here's the complete architecture:

**1. Database Schema Design**:
```sql
-- Optimized schema for analytics
CREATE TABLE events (
    event_id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    event_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    event_data JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    partition_date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
) PARTITION BY RANGE (partition_date);

-- Create partitions for each month
CREATE TABLE events_2024_01 PARTITION OF events
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');

CREATE TABLE events_2024_02 PARTITION OF events
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-02-01') TO ('2024-03-01');

-- Add indexes for common query patterns
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_events_user_date 
ON events(user_id, partition_date);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_events_type_date 
ON events(event_type, partition_date);

-- GIN index for JSONB queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_events_data 
ON events USING GIN (event_data);
```

**2. Performance-Optimized Configuration**:
```ini
# postgresql.conf optimizations
# Memory settings
shared_buffers = 2GB
effective_cache_size = 8GB
work_mem = 16MB
maintenance_work_mem = 256MB

# WAL settings for better write performance
wal_buffers = 16MB
checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9
wal_writer_delay = 200ms

# Query planner settings
random_page_cost = 1.1
effective_io_concurrency = 200

# Parallel query settings
max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 4
max_parallel_workers = 8
parallel_tuple_cost = 0.1
parallel_setup_cost = 1000.0
```

**3. Analytics Query Optimization**:
```sql
-- Materialized view for common aggregations
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_user_metrics AS
SELECT 
    partition_date,
    user_id,
    COUNT(*) as event_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT event_type) as event_types,
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'purchase' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as purchases
FROM events
GROUP BY partition_date, user_id;

-- Create index on materialized view
CREATE INDEX idx_daily_metrics_date_user 
ON daily_user_metrics(partition_date, user_id);

-- Refresh materialized view (run via cron)
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY daily_user_metrics;
```

**4. Connection Pooling Setup**:
```ini
# pgbouncer.ini for connection pooling
[databases]
analytics = host=localhost port=5432 dbname=analytics_db

[pgbouncer]
listen_port = 6432
listen_addr = 127.0.0.1
pool_mode = transaction
max_client_conn = 2000
default_pool_size = 50
max_db_connections = 100
max_user_connections = 100
```

**5. Monitoring and Maintenance**:
```sql
-- Automated partition creation
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_monthly_partition(table_name text, start_date date)
RETURNS void AS $$
DECLARE
    partition_name text;
    end_date date;
BEGIN
    partition_name := table_name || '_' || to_char(start_date, 'YYYY_MM');
    end_date := start_date + interval '1 month';
    
    EXECUTE format('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS %I PARTITION OF %I FOR VALUES FROM (%L) TO (%L)',
                   partition_name, table_name, start_date, end_date);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Create next month's partition
SELECT create_monthly_partition('events', date_trunc('month', current_date + interval '1 month')::date);
```

**6. Analytics Query Examples**:
```sql
-- Fast user activity query using partitioning
SELECT 
    user_id,
    COUNT(*) as total_events,
    COUNT(DISTINCT event_type) as unique_events
FROM events 
WHERE partition_date >= current_date - interval '30 days'
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;

-- Time-series analysis with window functions
SELECT 
    partition_date,
    COUNT(*) as daily_events,
    AVG(COUNT(*)) OVER (ORDER BY partition_date ROWS 7 PRECEDING) as weekly_avg
FROM events 
WHERE partition_date >= current_date - interval '90 days'
GROUP BY partition_date
ORDER BY partition_date;
```

**7. Performance Monitoring**:
```sql
-- Create performance monitoring views
CREATE VIEW slow_queries AS
SELECT 
    query,
    calls,
    total_time,
    mean_time,
    rows,
    round(100.0 * shared_blks_hit / nullif(shared_blks_hit + shared_blks_read, 0), 2) as hit_percent
FROM pg_stat_statements 
WHERE mean_time > 1000
ORDER BY mean_time DESC;

-- Monitor partition usage
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    attname,
    n_distinct,
    correlation
FROM pg_stats 
WHERE tablename LIKE 'events_%'
ORDER BY tablename, attname;
```

This setup can handle millions of records efficiently with:
- **Partitioning** for data management
- **Optimized indexes** for fast queries
- **Materialized views** for common aggregations
- **Connection pooling** for high concurrency
- **Automated maintenance** for partitions
- **Comprehensive monitoring** for performance tracking"
