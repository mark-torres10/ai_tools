## üìå Routing Guidelines

To determine which persona to use:

1. **Look for focus area overlap** between the task and the persona's expertise domains
2. **Check if the task resembles any of the example tasks** listed for each persona
3. **Consider the primary concern** of your task:
   - **Accessibility & WCAG Compliance** ‚Üí Frontend Accessibility Expert
   - **Component Design & Architecture** ‚Üí Frontend Component Architecture Expert
   - **Testing Strategy & Quality** ‚Üí Frontend Testing Expert
   - **Performance & Optimization** ‚Üí Frontend Performance Optimization Expert
   - **State Management & Data Flow** ‚Üí Frontend State Management Expert
4. **If the task requires multiple domains**, select multiple personas or the most relevant primary persona
5. **If no persona matches**, return:
   > **No matching persona found. Consider defining a new one.**

## Notes

- Each persona specializes in specific frontend development domains with deep expertise in their respective areas
- Many tasks may benefit from multiple personas working together for comprehensive solutions
- All personas follow the engineering persona specification and are designed for practical, production-ready implementations
- Consider the stage of your project (MVP, Growth, Enterprise) when selecting personas, as they provide context-aware recommendations
- These personas focus on specific technical challenges rather than general development, providing specialized expertise for complex frontend problems
