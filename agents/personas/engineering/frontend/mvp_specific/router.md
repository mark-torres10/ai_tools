## üìå Routing Guidelines

To determine which persona to use:

1. **Look for focus area overlap** between the task and the persona's expertise domains
2. **Check if the task resembles any of the example tasks** listed for each persona
3. **Consider the primary concern** of your task:
   - **Architecture & Patterns** ‚Üí MVP Frontend Architect Expert
   - **Feature Flags & Testing** ‚Üí MVP Feature Flag & A/B Testing Expert
   - **Demo & Presentation** ‚Üí MVP Frontend Demo Preparation Expert
   - **UI Components & Design System** ‚Üí MVP Rapid UI Component Expert
   - **Landing Pages & Conversion** ‚Üí MVP Landing Page Expert
   - **Mobile Experience** ‚Üí MVP Mobile-First Expert
   - **API Integration & Backend** ‚Üí MVP Rapid API Integration Expert
4. **If the task requires multiple domains**, select multiple personas or the most relevant primary persona
5. **If no persona matches**, return:
   > **No matching persona found. Consider defining a new one.**
