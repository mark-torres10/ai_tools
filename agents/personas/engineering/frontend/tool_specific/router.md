## üìå Routing Guidelines

To determine which persona to use:

1. **Look for focus area overlap** between the task and the persona's expertise domains
2. **Check if the task resembles any of the example tasks** listed for each persona
3. **Consider the primary concern** of your task:
   - **Build Tools & Bundlers** ‚Üí Build System Expert
   - **CSS & Styling Architecture** ‚Üí Tailwind CSS Architecture Expert
   - **Next.js & React Framework** ‚Üí Next.js Expert
   - **React Performance & Optimization** ‚Üí React Performance Expert
   - **Component Libraries & Design Systems** ‚Üí shadcn/ui Expert
   - **TypeScript & Type Safety** ‚Üí TypeScript Expert
4. **If the task requires multiple domains**, select multiple personas or the most relevant primary persona
5. **If no persona matches**, return:
   > **No matching persona found. Consider defining a new one.**
