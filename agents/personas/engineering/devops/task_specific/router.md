## üìå Routing Guidelines

To determine which persona to use:

1. **Look for focus area overlap** between the task and the persona's expertise domains
2. **Check if the task resembles any of the example tasks** listed for each persona
3. **Consider the primary concern** of your task:
   - **Incidents & Alerts** ‚Üí SRE Incident Response Expert
   - **Performance & Scalability** ‚Üí SRE Performance Engineering Expert
   - **Reliability & Resilience** ‚Üí SRE Reliability Engineering Expert
   - **Deployment & Pipelines** ‚Üí CI/CD Pipeline Expert
   - **Network Security** ‚Üí Network Security Expert
   - **Container Security** ‚Üí Container Security Expert
4. **If the task requires multiple domains**, select multiple personas or the most relevant primary persona
5. **If no persona matches**, return:
   > **No matching persona found. Consider defining a new one.**
