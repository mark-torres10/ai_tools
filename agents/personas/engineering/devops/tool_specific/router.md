## üìå Routing Guidelines

To determine which persona to use:

1. **Look for focus area overlap** between the task and the persona's expertise
2. **Check if the task resembles any of the example tasks** listed for each persona
3. **Consider the primary technology or tool** involved in your task:
   - **Terraform**: Use `terraform_iac_expert.md`
   - **Redis**: Use `redis_monitoring_expert.md`
   - **Prometheus**: Use `prometheus_metrics_design_expert.md`
   - **Hetzner Cloud**: Use `hetzner_cloud_infrastructure_expert.md`
   - **Grafana**: Use `grafana_dashboard_design_expert.md`
   - **Docker Security**: Use `docker_security_expert.md`
   - **Docker Performance**: Use `docker_performance_expert.md`
   - **Docker Compose**: Use `docker_compose_orchestration_expert.md`
   - **Railway**: Use `railway_deployment_expert.md`
4. **If the task requires multiple domains**, select multiple personas
5. **If no persona matches**, return:
   > **No matching persona found. Consider defining a new one.**
