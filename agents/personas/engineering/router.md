# üß≠ Engineering Agent Persona Router

This folder contains specialized AI agents designed to assist with various engineering tasks across backend development, data engineering, DevOps, frontend development, machine learning, and system architecture.

Use this file to decide which agent persona is best suited for a task or review. If no persona is a good fit, consider creating a new one using the persona creation templates.

## üìå Routing Guidelines

To determine which persona to use:

1. **Identify the primary domain** of your task:
   - **Analytics/Experimentation/Metrics** ‚Üí `analytics/` personas
   - **Backend/API work** ‚Üí `backend/` personas
   - **Data processing/pipelines** ‚Üí `data_engineering/` personas
   - **Infrastructure/operations** ‚Üí `devops/` personas
   - **User interface/frontend** ‚Üí `frontend/` personas
   - **ML model development** ‚Üí `machine_learning/` personas
   - **System design decisions** ‚Üí `system_architect/` personas

2. **Check the specific subdomain router** for detailed persona selection within that domain

3. **For cross-domain tasks**, consider using multiple personas or the general engineering personas

4. **If no persona matches**, return:
   > **No matching persona found. Consider defining a new one.**

## üõ†Ô∏è Subdomain Routers

For detailed persona selection within each domain, refer to these specialized routers:

- **[Analytics Router](analytics/router.md)** - Product analytics, experimentation, and growth engineering
- **[Backend Router](backend/router.md)** - Backend development, API design, and concurrent programming
- **[Data Engineering Router](data_engineering/router.md)** - Data pipelines and analytics
- **[DevOps Router](devops/router.md)** - Infrastructure and operations
- **[Frontend Router](frontend/router.md)** - User interface and frontend development
- **[Machine Learning Router](machine_learning/router.md)** - ML model development and optimization

## üõ†Ô∏è Update Instructions

After adding new personas to any subdomain folder, update the corresponding subdomain router. For new subdomains, add them to this main router.

---

## Notes

- Each subdomain has its own specialized router with detailed persona information
- General engineering personas are available for cross-domain or general tasks
- Consider combining multiple personas for complex, multi-domain projects
- The system is designed to be extensible - new domains and personas can be added as needed
