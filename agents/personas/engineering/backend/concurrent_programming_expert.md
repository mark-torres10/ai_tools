## Concurrent Programming Rubric Checklist

**Core Principle**: "Concurrency is not parallelism. Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once." - Rob Pike

**CRITICAL**: This rubric MUST be consulted for EVERY concurrent programming task. Work through each section systematically to write correct, efficient concurrent code.

### Phase 0: Foundation - Understanding Concurrency Models

**Purpose**: Choose the right concurrency model for your problem before writing code. The model determines how you think about concurrent execution.

**Leslie Lamport's Key Insight**: "A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn't even know existed can render your own computer unusable."

- [ ] **Identify the Concurrency Model of Your Language/Framework**
  - Determine what concurrency primitives are available
  - Understand the default execution model (threads vs. green threads vs. event loop)
  - Know the memory model guarantees
  - Check if blocking operations are allowed or prohibited
  
  **Concurrency Models by Language:**
  
  | Language | Primary Model | Key Primitives | Blocking Allowed? |
  |----------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
  | Go | CSP (channels) | goroutines, channels, select | Yes |
  | Erlang | Actor | processes, mailboxes, receive | Yes (per-process) |
  | Java | Shared Memory | threads, locks, j.u.c | Yes |
  | JavaScript | Event Loop | Promises, async/await | No (blocks entire thread) |
  | Rust | Mixed | async/await, channels, Arc/Mutex | Yes (but avoid in async) |
  | Python | Mixed | threading, asyncio, multiprocessing | GIL limits parallelism |
  | C++ | Shared Memory | std::thread, std::atomic, mutex | Yes |
  
  **Examples:**
  - ✅ GOOD: "Go uses CSP, so I'll communicate via channels instead of shared state"
  - ✅ GOOD: "JavaScript is event-loop, so I must use async/await for I/O operations"
  - ❌ BAD: "I'll use threads in JavaScript" (no threads in browser JS)
  - ❌ BAD: "I'll block in async Rust" (blocks entire executor thread)
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Model mismatch**: Using shared-memory patterns in CSP languages
  - **Blocking in event loops**: Blocking I/O in JavaScript/Python asyncio
  - **Thread assumptions**: Assuming goroutines are threads (they're not)
  - **GIL ignorance**: Using threading for CPU-bound work in Python
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Read the language memory model specification (Java JMM, C++ memory model)
  - Understand if concurrency is cooperative (async) or preemptive (threads)
  - Check what happens on panic/exception in concurrent context
  - Know the scheduler characteristics (work-stealing, round-robin, etc.)

- [ ] **Choose Message Passing vs. Shared Memory**
  - Prefer message passing when possible (CSP, Actor)
  - Use shared memory only when necessary (performance, atomic counters)
  - Understand the trade-offs of each approach
  - Design clear ownership boundaries
  
  **Decision Matrix:**
  
  | Use Message Passing When | Use Shared Memory When |
  |--------------------------|------------------------|
  | Communication is primary | Data is naturally shared (cache, config) |
  | Natural ownership boundaries | High-frequency updates (atomic counters) |
  | Need clear synchronization points | Very low latency required |
  | Working with distributed systems | Lock-free algorithms |
  
  **Message Passing Patterns (CSP/Actor):**
  ```
  // Go CSP - channel ownership
  func producer() <-chan int {
      ch := make(chan int)
      go func() {
          defer close(ch)  // Producer owns channel, closes it
          for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
              ch <- i
          }
      }()
      return ch  // Return receive-only channel
  }
  
  func consumer(ch <-chan int) {
      for val := range ch {  // Reads until channel closed
          process(val)
      }
  }
  ```
  
  **Shared Memory Pattern (with proper synchronization):**
  ```
  // Java - shared counter with AtomicInteger
  private final AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0);
  
  public void increment() {
      counter.incrementAndGet();  // Atomic, no lock needed
  }
  
  public int get() {
      return counter.get();
  }
  ```
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Mixed models**: Using both message passing and shared memory inconsistently
  - **Hidden sharing**: Message contains mutable shared reference
  - **No ownership**: Unclear who owns the data
  - **Over-synchronization**: Locking when message passing would be clearer
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - "Share memory by communicating, don't communicate by sharing memory" (Go proverb)
  - Make data ownership explicit in documentation
  - Prefer immutable messages (no shared mutable state in message)
  - Use channels/queues for synchronization points

- [ ] **Understand Your Memory Model**
  - Know the happens-before guarantees
  - Understand visibility rules for shared variables
  - Learn the available memory orderings
  - Recognize when synchronization is needed
  
  **Memory Model Guarantees:**
  
  **Sequential Consistency** (easiest to reason about, most expensive):
  - All operations appear in a total order
  - Each thread's operations appear in program order
  - Example: Java `volatile` reads/writes, C++ `memory_order_seq_cst`
  
  **Happens-Before** (most memory models):
  - Operation A happens-before B if A's effects are visible to B
  - Synchronized blocks create happens-before relationships
  - Channel send happens-before channel receive (Go)
  - Write to `volatile` happens-before read from `volatile` (Java)
  
  **Acquire-Release** (C++, more relaxed):
  - `memory_order_acquire` ensures subsequent reads see prior writes
  - `memory_order_release` ensures prior writes visible to acquire
  - Use for building synchronization primitives
  
  **Relaxed** (C++, weakest guarantees):
  - `memory_order_relaxed` only guarantees atomicity, not ordering
  - Use for simple atomic counters where ordering doesn't matter
  
  **Examples:**
  - ✅ GOOD - Proper synchronization:
  ```
  // Thread 1
  data = 42;
  ready.store(true, memory_order_release);
  
  // Thread 2
  while (!ready.load(memory_order_acquire));
  assert(data == 42);  // Guaranteed to be true
  ```
  
  - ❌ BAD - Missing synchronization:
  ```
  // Thread 1
  data = 42;  // Not atomic, not synchronized
  
  // Thread 2
  assert(data == 42);  // May fail! No happens-before
  ```
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **No synchronization**: Assuming writes are immediately visible
  - **Wrong memory order**: Using relaxed when acquire-release needed
  - **False security**: Thinking `volatile` (Java) prevents all race conditions
  - **Reordering ignorance**: Not understanding compiler/CPU can reorder operations
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Start with sequential consistency, optimize to weaker models only when needed
  - Use language-provided synchronization (channels, mutexes) instead of manual memory ordering
  - Read cppreference.com for C++ memory model, JSR-133 for Java
  - Remember: memory model guarantees are minimal, actual hardware may do better

- [ ] **Design for Testability**
  - Inject dependencies (clocks, schedulers, randomness)
  - Make timing parameters configurable
  - Design deterministic execution paths when possible
  - Plan for stress testing and race detection
  
  **Testable Concurrency Patterns:**
  ```
  // Inject clock for testability
  type Clock interface {
      Now() time.Time
      Sleep(time.Duration)
  }
  
  type Service struct {
      clock Clock  // Injected, can be mocked
  }
  
  // Production: use real clock
  svc := NewService(RealClock{})
  
  // Test: use fake clock for deterministic tests
  svc := NewService(FakeClock{})
  ```
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Hard-coded timing**: `time.Sleep(100*time.Millisecond)` in production code
  - **Hidden concurrency**: Spawning goroutines/threads inside functions
  - **Global state**: Shared mutable globals make tests interfere
  - **No injection points**: Can't control scheduling or timing
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Make concurrency explicit in function signatures (return channels, accept context)
  - Use dependency injection for anything concurrent (timers, executors)
  - Provide synchronous versions of async APIs for testing
  - Run tests with race detectors and stress test modes

**Red Flags in Phase 0:**
- 🚨 Don't know the concurrency model of your language/framework
- 🚨 Mixing concurrency models inconsistently
- 🚨 Don't understand happens-before relationships
- 🚨 No strategy for testing concurrent code
- 🚨 Blocking operations in event-loop languages
- 🚨 Using threads in Python for CPU-bound work (GIL)

### Phase 1: Synchronization Primitives - Mutexes, Locks, Atomics

**Purpose**: Master synchronization primitives to protect shared state correctly without deadlocks or race conditions.

**Dijkstra's Key Insight**: "The question of whether a computer can think is like the question of whether a submarine can swim." On concurrency: simplicity and correctness first, optimization second.

- [ ] **Use Mutexes Correctly**
  - Always unlock in defer/finally/RAII
  - Keep critical sections small
  - Never call foreign code while holding lock
  - Establish lock ordering to prevent deadlock
  - Use read-write locks for read-heavy workloads
  
  **Mutex Patterns:**
  - ✅ GOOD - Minimal critical section:
  ```
  func (c *Cache) Get(key string) (Value, bool) {
      c.mu.RLock()  // Read lock
      defer c.mu.RUnlock()  // Always defer
      val, ok := c.data[key]
      return val, ok  // Small critical section
  }
  ```
  
  - ❌ BAD - Large critical section, I/O while holding lock:
  ```
  func (c *Cache) Get(key string) (Value, bool) {
      c.mu.Lock()  // Write lock when read would suffice
      val, ok := c.data[key]
      if !ok {
          val = expensiveDatabaseQuery(key)  // ❌ I/O while holding lock!
          c.data[key] = val
      }
      c.mu.Unlock()  // ❌ Not deferred, may not unlock on panic
      return val, ok
  }
  ```
  
  **Lock Ordering to Prevent Deadlock:**
  ```
  // Define consistent global ordering
  type Account struct {
      id int
      mu sync.Mutex
      balance int
  }
  
  func transfer(from, to *Account, amount int) {
      // Always lock in ID order
      first, second := from, to
      if from.id > to.id {
          first, second = second, first
      }
      
      first.mu.Lock()
      defer first.mu.Unlock()
      second.mu.Lock()
      defer second.mu.Unlock()
      
      from.balance -= amount
      to.balance += amount
  }
  ```
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Not deferring unlock**: Forgetting to unlock on error path
  - **Large critical sections**: Holding lock while doing I/O or computation
  - **Nested locks**: Taking multiple locks without ordering
  - **Wrong lock type**: Using write lock when read lock suffices
  - **Lock inversion**: Different functions lock in different orders
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Use read-write locks (`RWMutex`) when reads >> writes
  - Profile lock contention with `-trace` or profilers
  - Consider lock-free alternatives for very hot paths
  - Document lock ordering in comments

- [ ] **Apply Atomic Operations**
  - Use for simple counters, flags, pointers
  - Understand memory ordering implications
  - Know when CAS (compare-and-swap) is needed
  - Prefer higher-level primitives when available
  
  **Atomic Patterns:**
  - ✅ GOOD - Simple atomic counter:
  ```
  type Counter struct {
      value atomic.Int64
  }
  
  func (c *Counter) Inc() {
      c.value.Add(1)  // Atomic increment
  }
  
  func (c *Counter) Get() int64 {
      return c.value.Load()
  }
  ```
  
  - ❌ BAD - Non-atomic read-modify-write:
  ```
  type Counter struct {
      value int
      mu sync.Mutex
  }
  
  func (c *Counter) Inc() {
      // Overkill - mutex for simple counter
      c.mu.Lock()
      c.value++
      c.mu.Unlock()
  }
  ```
  
  **CAS (Compare-And-Swap) Pattern:**
  ```
  func (c *Counter) CompareAndSwap(old, new int64) bool {
      return c.value.CompareAndSwap(old, new)
  }
  
  // Retry loop with CAS
  func (c *Counter) MultiplyBy(factor int64) {
      for {
          old := c.value.Load()
          new := old * factor
          if c.value.CompareAndSwap(old, new) {
              return  // Success
          }
          // Retry on CAS failure
      }
  }
  ```
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Compound operations**: Atomic load + modify + store (needs CAS loop)
  - **Wrong memory order**: Using relaxed when stronger guarantees needed
  - **ABA problem**: CAS succeeds but value changed A→B→A
  - **Overusing atomics**: Using atomics when mutex would be clearer
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Atomics are for building synchronization primitives, not general use
  - Use mutex for complex multi-variable updates
  - CAS retry loops are lock-free but not wait-free
  - Check for ABA problem in lock-free algorithms (use tagged pointers)

- [ ] **Avoid Deadlocks**
  - Establish global lock ordering
  - Use timeouts when acquiring locks
  - Minimize number of locks held simultaneously
  - Use deadlock detection tools
  - Consider lock-free alternatives
  
  **Deadlock Prevention Strategies:**
  
  **1. Lock Ordering** (most common):
  ```
  // Define ordering: always lock by ID
  func transferWithOrdering(from, to *Account, amount int) {
      accounts := []*Account{from, to}
      sort.Slice(accounts, func(i, j int) bool {
          return accounts[i].id < accounts[j].id
      })
      
      for _, acc := range accounts {
          acc.mu.Lock()
          defer acc.mu.Unlock()
      }
      
      from.balance -= amount
      to.balance += amount
  }
  ```
  
  **2. Timeouts** (for distributed systems):
  ```
  func lockWithTimeout(mu *sync.Mutex, timeout time.Duration) bool {
      locked := make(chan struct{})
      go func() {
          mu.Lock()
          close(locked)
      }()
      
      select {
      case <-locked:
          return true
      case <-time.After(timeout):
          return false  // Timeout, didn't acquire lock
      }
  }
  ```
  
  **3. Try-Lock** (non-blocking):
  ```
  func tryLock(mu *sync.Mutex) bool {
      locked := make(chan struct{}, 1)
      go func() {
          mu.Lock()
          locked <- struct{}{}
      }()
      
      select {
      case <-locked:
          return true
      default:
          return false
      }
  }
  ```
  
  **Detecting Deadlocks:**
  - ✅ Use deadlock detectors: Go deadlock detector, Helgrind (Valgrind)
  - ✅ Monitor lock wait times in production
  - ✅ Log lock acquisitions in development
  - ✅ Use static analysis tools (lockdep, ThreadSanitizer)
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Circular wait**: Thread A waits for B, B waits for A
  - **No timeout**: Blocking forever on lock acquisition
  - **Callback hell**: Calling unknown code while holding lock
  - **Hidden locks**: Library functions that take locks
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Document lock ordering in package-level comments
  - Use `-race` detector (Go) to catch potential deadlocks
  - Consider using channels instead of locks for simpler synchronization
  - Visualize lock dependencies with tools like `go-deadlock`

- [ ] **Use Condition Variables Correctly**
  - Always wait in a loop (spurious wakeups)
  - Hold the associated mutex when calling wait/signal
  - Use broadcast vs. signal appropriately
  - Avoid thundering herd problem
  
  **Condition Variable Pattern:**
  ```
  type Queue struct {
      mu    sync.Mutex
      cond  *sync.Cond
      items []Item
  }
  
  func NewQueue() *Queue {
      q := &Queue{}
      q.cond = sync.NewCond(&q.mu)
      return q
  }
  
  func (q *Queue) Enqueue(item Item) {
      q.mu.Lock()
      defer q.mu.Unlock()
      
      q.items = append(q.items, item)
      q.cond.Signal()  // Wake one waiter
  }
  
  func (q *Queue) Dequeue() Item {
      q.mu.Lock()
      defer q.mu.Unlock()
      
      for len(q.items) == 0 {  // ✅ Always wait in loop
          q.cond.Wait()  // Releases lock, waits, reacquires
      }
      
      item := q.items[0]
      q.items = q.items[1:]
      return item
  }
  ```
  
  **Broadcast vs. Signal:**
  - `Signal()`: Wake one waiter (producer-consumer)
  - `Broadcast()`: Wake all waiters (config change, shutdown)
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Not waiting in loop**: Missing spurious wakeups
  - **Wrong signal type**: Using Signal when Broadcast needed
  - **Thundering herd**: Broadcasting when signal would suffice
  - **Forgetting to hold lock**: Wait/Signal must hold associated mutex
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Condition variables are low-level, prefer channels (Go) when possible
  - Use bounded channels instead of condition variables for queues
  - Document what condition the condition variable represents
  - Consider using semaphores for simpler cases

**Red Flags in Phase 1:**
- 🚨 Not deferring mutex unlock (risk of deadlock on panic)
- 🚨 Holding lock while calling I/O or unknown code
- 🚨 No lock ordering (circular dependencies possible)
- 🚨 Using atomics for compound operations without CAS loop
- 🚨 Condition variable wait not in a loop
- 🚨 Never tested with race detector or deadlock detector

### Phase 2: Memory Models - Happens-Before, Memory Ordering

**Purpose**: Understand memory model guarantees to write correct concurrent code without data races.

**Leslie Lamport's Key Insight**: "A system has the property P if all its behaviors satisfy P. The property 'no data races' requires understanding the happens-before relationship."

- [ ] **Understand Happens-Before Relationships**
  - Learn happens-before rules for your language
  - Identify synchronization points
  - Recognize when happens-before is guaranteed
  - Understand transitive happens-before
  
  **Happens-Before Rules (Java/Go-style):**
  
  1. **Program Order**: Within a thread, A before B → A happens-before B
  2. **Monitor Lock**: Unlock happens-before every subsequent lock of same monitor
  3. **Volatile Write**: Write to volatile happens-before every subsequent read
  4. **Thread Start**: Thread.start() happens-before first action in thread
  5. **Thread Join**: Last action in thread happens-before join() returns
  6. **Transitivity**: A happens-before B, B happens-before C → A happens-before C
  
  **Channel Happens-Before (Go):**
  - Channel send happens-before corresponding receive completes
  - Channel close happens-before receive of zero value
  - Receive from unbuffered channel happens-before send completes
  
  **Examples:**
  - ✅ GOOD - Happens-before via channel:
  ```
  var data int
  done := make(chan struct{})
  
  go func() {
      data = 42          // 1. Write
      close(done)        // 2. Close channel (happens-before receive)
  }()
  
  <-done                 // 3. Receive (happens-after close)
  fmt.Println(data)      // 4. Read (happens-after write via 2→3)
  // Guaranteed to print 42
  ```
  
  - ❌ BAD - No happens-before:
  ```
  var data int
  var ready bool
  
  go func() {
      data = 42
      ready = true  // ❌ Not synchronized, no happens-before
  }()
  
  for !ready {}  // ❌ May loop forever! (cached read)
  fmt.Println(data)  // ❌ May print 0! (no happens-before)
  ```
  
  **Visualizing Happens-Before:**
  ```
  Thread A                           Thread B
  --------                           --------
  x = 1                    ─────┐
  mutex.Lock()             <────┤ Happens-before
  y = 2                         │
  mutex.Unlock()           ─────┤
                                └───> mutex.Lock()
                                      z = x + y  // Sees x=1, y=2
                                      mutex.Unlock()
  ```
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Assuming visibility**: Thinking writes are immediately visible
  - **Benign data race**: "It's okay if we read stale value" (it's not - undefined behavior)
  - **Missing synchronization**: Reading shared variable without synchronization
  - **Out-of-order execution**: Forgetting compiler/CPU can reorder
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Use race detectors to find missing happens-before relationships
  - Draw thread diagrams with happens-before arrows
  - Prefer high-level primitives (channels, mutexes) over manual synchronization
  - Read your language's memory model specification

- [ ] **Apply Memory Ordering (C++/Rust)**
  - Understand seq_cst (sequential consistency)
  - Use acquire-release for synchronization
  - Apply relaxed for simple counters
  - Know when memory fences are needed
  
  **Memory Ordering Hierarchy (C++):**
  
  ```
  memory_order_seq_cst    // Strongest: total order, all threads agree
        ↓
  memory_order_acq_rel    // Middle: synchronization without total order
        ↓
  memory_order_acquire    // Load: prevent reordering of subsequent reads
  memory_order_release    // Store: prevent reordering of prior writes
        ↓
  memory_order_relaxed    // Weakest: only atomicity, no ordering
  ```
  
  **Sequential Consistency (Default, Strongest):**
  ```
  // C++ - Total order
  atomic<int> x{0}, y{0};
  atomic<int> r1, r2;
  
  // Thread 1
  x.store(1, memory_order_seq_cst);
  r1 = y.load(memory_order_seq_cst);
  
  // Thread 2
  y.store(1, memory_order_seq_cst);
  r2 = x.load(memory_order_seq_cst);
  
  // Impossible: r1 == 0 && r2 == 0 (total order guarantees)
  ```
  
  **Acquire-Release (Synchronization):**
  ```
  // C++ - Publisher-subscriber
  atomic<bool> ready{false};
  int data = 0;
  
  // Thread 1 (Publisher)
  data = 42;
  ready.store(true, memory_order_release);  // Publish
  
  // Thread 2 (Subscriber)
  while (!ready.load(memory_order_acquire));  // Wait
  assert(data == 42);  // Guaranteed!
  ```
  
  **Relaxed (Simple Counters):**
  ```
  // C++ - Atomic counter (order doesn't matter)
  atomic<int> counter{0};
  
  void increment() {
      counter.fetch_add(1, memory_order_relaxed);
  }
  
  int get() {
      return counter.load(memory_order_relaxed);
  }
  // Only need atomicity, not ordering
  ```
  
  **Memory Fences:**
  ```
  // Explicit fence for complex scenarios
  atomic_thread_fence(memory_order_acquire);  // Load barrier
  atomic_thread_fence(memory_order_release);  // Store barrier
  atomic_thread_fence(memory_order_seq_cst);  // Full barrier
  ```
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Always using seq_cst**: Overconservative, performance cost
  - **Wrong pairing**: Release without matching acquire
  - **Relaxed compound operations**: Relaxed load-modify-store loses updates
  - **Fence confusion**: Not understanding when fences needed
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Start with `seq_cst`, optimize to weaker only when profiling shows need
  - Use `acquire-release` for building synchronization primitives
  - Relaxed only for simple atomic counters where order doesn't matter
  - Read cppreference.com memory order examples carefully

- [ ] **Detect Data Races**
  - Run with race detector (Go -race, ThreadSanitizer)
  - Understand data race vs. race condition
  - Know that data races cause undefined behavior
  - Use happens-before analysis to verify correctness
  
  **Data Race vs. Race Condition:**
  - **Data Race**: Unsynchronized concurrent access to memory, at least one write (undefined behavior)
  - **Race Condition**: Program behavior depends on timing/ordering (may be intentional or bug)
  
  **Example:**
  ```
  // Data race (undefined behavior!)
  var x int
  
  go func() { x = 1 }()  // ❌ Concurrent write
  go func() { println(x) }()  // ❌ Concurrent read
  // This is data race!
  ```
  
  ```
  // Race condition (may be bug, but not data race)
  ch := make(chan int, 1)
  
  go func() { ch <- 1 }()
  go func() { ch <- 2 }()
  
  val := <-ch  // Will get either 1 or 2 (nondeterministic, but not data race)
  ```
  
  **Race Detector Output (Go):**
  ```
  WARNING: DATA RACE
  Write at 0x00c000018090 by goroutine 7:
    main.main.func1()
        main.go:10 +0x38
  
  Previous read at 0x00c000018090 by goroutine 6:
    main.main.func2()
        main.go:13 +0x3c
  ```
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **"Benign" races**: Thinking some data races are okay (they're not!)
  - **Only testing in dev**: Not running race detector in CI
  - **Ignoring warnings**: Dismissing race detector output
  - **False confidence**: Passing tests without race detector
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Add `-race` to all CI test runs (Go)
  - Use ThreadSanitizer (TSan) for C/C++/Rust
  - Race detector has no false positives (all reports are real bugs)
  - Can miss races (needs to execute the racy code path)
  - Use static analysis tools (Go vet, Clippy) as complement

**Red Flags in Phase 2:**
- 🚨 Don't understand happens-before relationships
- 🚨 Never ran code with race detector
- 🚨 Think data races are acceptable ("benign race")
- 🚨 Using relaxed atomics without understanding implications
- 🚨 Can't explain why code is data-race-free
- 🚨 Assuming reads/writes are atomic (they're often not!)

### Phase 3: Lock-Free Programming - CAS, Lock-Free Data Structures

**Purpose**: Master lock-free techniques for building high-performance concurrent data structures.

**Maurice Herlihy's Key Insight**: "Lock-free algorithms guarantee system-wide progress. If one thread is suspended, others can still make progress."

- [ ] **Understand Compare-And-Swap (CAS)**
  - Learn CAS semantics: atomic read-modify-write
  - Master CAS retry loops
  - Recognize the ABA problem
  - Know when lock-free is appropriate
  
  **CAS Operation:**
  ```
  bool CAS(location, expected, new) {
      if (*location == expected) {
          *location = new;
          return true;  // Success
      }
      return false;  // Failed, location != expected
  }
  ```
  
  **CAS Retry Loop Pattern:**
  ```
  // Atomic increment using CAS
  func incrementAtomic(counter *atomic.Int64) {
      for {
          old := counter.Load()
          new := old + 1
          if counter.CompareAndSwap(old, new) {
              return  // Success
          }
          // CAS failed, retry
      }
  }
  ```
  
  **ABA Problem:**
  ```
  // Thread 1                    // Thread 2
  old = head.Load()  // A
                                  head.Store(B)
                                  head.Store(A)  // Same value!
  CAS(head, old, new)  // ✅ Succeeds, but A changed!
  ```
  
  **ABA Solutions:**
  1. **Tagged Pointers**: Add version counter
  ```
  type TaggedPtr struct {
      ptr   unsafe.Pointer
      tag   uint64  // Version number
  }
  
  func (p *TaggedPtr) CAS(old, new TaggedPtr) bool {
      // Compare both pointer AND tag
      return atomic.CompareAndSwapUint64(
          (*uint64)(unsafe.Pointer(&p.ptr)),
          *(*uint64)(unsafe.Pointer(&old)),
          *(*uint64)(unsafe.Pointer(&new)),
      )
  }
  ```
  
  2. **Hazard Pointers**: Mark pointers in-use
  3. **Epoch-Based Reclamation**: Defer deletion until safe
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Infinite retry**: CAS loop under heavy contention
  - **ABA ignorance**: Not recognizing ABA problem
  - **Wrong granularity**: CAS on wrong level of abstraction
  - **Memory ordering**: Using relaxed CAS when stronger guarantees needed
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Lock-free is NOT faster than locks in low contention
  - Use lock-free for scalability, not raw performance
  - Backoff strategies reduce CAS retry contention
  - Consider bounded retries to prevent livelock

- [ ] **Implement Lock-Free Data Structures**
  - Start with Treiber stack (simplest)
  - Understand Michael-Scott queue (more complex)
  - Use hazard pointers for safe memory reclamation
  - Test with stress tests and model checkers
  
  **Treiber Stack (Lock-Free LIFO):**
  ```
  type Node struct {
      value int
      next  *Node
  }
  
  type TreiberStack struct {
      head atomic.Pointer[Node]
  }
  
  func (s *TreiberStack) Push(value int) {
      newNode := &Node{value: value}
      for {
          oldHead := s.head.Load()
          newNode.next = oldHead
          if s.head.CompareAndSwap(oldHead, newNode) {
              return  // Success
          }
          // Retry on CAS failure
      }
  }
  
  func (s *TreiberStack) Pop() (int, bool) {
      for {
          oldHead := s.head.Load()
          if oldHead == nil {
              return 0, false  // Empty
          }
          newHead := oldHead.next
          if s.head.CompareAndSwap(oldHead, newHead) {
              return oldHead.value, true  // Success
          }
          // Retry on CAS failure
      }
  }
  ```
  
  **Michael-Scott Queue (Lock-Free FIFO):**
  ```
  type MSQueue struct {
      head atomic.Pointer[Node]
      tail atomic.Pointer[Node]
  }
  
  func NewMSQueue() *MSQueue {
      dummy := &Node{}
      q := &MSQueue{}
      q.head.Store(dummy)
      q.tail.Store(dummy)
      return q
  }
  
  func (q *MSQueue) Enqueue(value int) {
      newNode := &Node{value: value}
      for {
          tail := q.tail.Load()
          next := tail.next.Load()
          
          if tail == q.tail.Load() {  // Still consistent?
              if next == nil {
                  if tail.next.CompareAndSwap(nil, newNode) {
                      q.tail.CompareAndSwap(tail, newNode)
                      return
                  }
              } else {
                  q.tail.CompareAndSwap(tail, next)  // Help other thread
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Memory leaks**: Not reclaiming nodes safely
  - **ABA problem**: Reusing freed nodes without version tags
  - **Livelock**: Helping algorithm causes infinite loop
  - **Complexity**: Lock-free queue is 10× harder than lock-based
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Use hazard pointers or epoch-based reclamation for safe deletion
  - Stress test with thousands of threads
  - Use bounded-wait backoff to reduce contention
  - Consider using battle-tested libraries (crossbeam, java.util.concurrent)

- [ ] **Understand Progress Guarantees**
  - **Wait-Free**: Every thread makes progress in bounded steps
  - **Lock-Free**: System-wide progress guaranteed (at least one thread progresses)
  - **Obstruction-Free**: Progress if running in isolation
  - **Blocking**: No progress guarantee (mutex-based)
  
  **Progress Guarantee Hierarchy:**
  ```
  Wait-Free > Lock-Free > Obstruction-Free > Blocking
   (Strongest)                              (Weakest)
  ```
  
  **Examples:**
  - **Wait-Free**: Atomic fetch-and-add (bounded steps)
  - **Lock-Free**: Treiber stack (some thread always succeeds CAS)
  - **Obstruction-Free**: Double-checked locking (progress if alone)
  - **Blocking**: Mutex (no thread progresses if holder suspended)
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Confusing terms**: "Lock-free" doesn't mean "no locks" (means progress guarantee)
  - **False wait-free**: CAS retry loop is lock-free, not wait-free
  - **Livelock**: Lock-free doesn't prevent livelock
  - **Starvation**: Lock-free can still starve individual threads
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Wait-free is ideal but hard to implement
  - Lock-free is practical compromise
  - Lock-free != faster (just better progress guarantee)
  - Use locks unless you need scalability under contention

**Red Flags in Phase 3:**
- 🚨 Using lock-free without understanding ABA problem
- 🚨 Implementing lock-free data structures from scratch (use libraries!)
- 🚨 No memory reclamation strategy (hazard pointers, epochs)
- 🚨 Infinite CAS retry loops without backoff
- 🚨 Thinking lock-free is always faster than locks
- 🚨 Not stress testing lock-free code

### Phase 4: Testing & Debugging - Race Detection, Property Testing, Deterministic Schedulers

**Purpose**: Build confidence in concurrent code through systematic testing and debugging.

**Leslie Lamport's Key Insight**: "Testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs." For concurrent code, this is even more true - you need systematic approaches.

- [ ] **Use Race Detectors**
  - Run ALL tests with race detector in CI
  - Use ThreadSanitizer (C/C++/Rust)
  - Apply Go -race flag
  - Understand false negatives (coverage-dependent)
  
  **Race Detector Integration:**
  ```
  # Go - run tests with race detector
  go test -race ./...
  
  # CI integration (GitHub Actions example)
  - name: Run tests with race detector
    run: go test -race -v ./...
  
  # C++/Rust - build with ThreadSanitizer
  CXXFLAGS="-fsanitize=thread" make test
  cargo test --target-dir tsan -- --test-threads=1
  ```
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Only running in dev**: Not in CI
  - **Ignoring reports**: Dismissing race detector output
  - **Coverage gaps**: Race detector only finds races in executed code paths
  - **Performance impact**: Race detector 10× slower (dev-only)
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Run race detector on every CI build
  - Increase test iterations for better coverage: `-count=100`
  - Use stress tests to exercise rare interleavings
  - Race detector has no false positives (all reports are real bugs)

- [ ] **Apply Property-Based Testing**
  - Use QuickCheck-style testing for concurrency
  - Generate random concurrent schedules
  - Check invariants hold under all schedules
  - Shrink failing test cases to minimal reproduction
  
  **Property-Based Concurrency Testing:**
  ```
  // Using quickcheck-state-machine (Haskell)
  prop_parallel :: Property
  prop_parallel = forAll commands $ \cmds ->
      monadicIO $ do
          (hist, res) <- run $ runParallel cmds
          assert $ linearizable hist
  
  // Check that concurrent executions are linearizable
  // (equivalent to some sequential execution)
  ```
  
  **Go Example with go-fuzz:**
  ```
  func FuzzConcurrentMap(f *testing.F) {
      f.Fuzz(func(t *testing.T, data []byte) {
          m := NewConcurrentMap()
          
          // Parse data into concurrent operations
          ops := parseOperations(data)
          
          // Run operations concurrently
          var wg sync.WaitGroup
          for _, op := range ops {
              wg.Add(1)
              go func(op Operation) {
                  defer wg.Done()
                  executeOp(m, op)
              }(op)
          }
          wg.Wait()
          
          // Check invariants
          checkInvariants(t, m)
      })
  }
  ```
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Only testing happy path**: Not generating edge cases
  - **No invariant checking**: Running operations without verification
  - **Sequential tests**: Not actually testing concurrency
  - **Poor shrinking**: Can't minimize failing test cases
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Use libraries: QuickCheck (Haskell), Hypothesis (Python), rapid (Go)
  - Define clear invariants to check
  - Generate diverse schedules (not just sequential)
  - Combine with race detector for maximum coverage

- [ ] **Use Deterministic Schedulers**
  - Test with controlled scheduling
  - Reproduce race conditions reliably
  - Explore all interleavings systematically
  - Use model checking for critical code
  
  **Deterministic Testing Tools:**
  
  **Hermit (Deterministic Execution):**
  ```
  # Make concurrent program deterministic
  hermit run --strict ./my-concurrent-program
  
  # Same schedule every time, deterministic output
  ```
  
  **Coyote (Systematic Testing):**
  ```
  [Microsoft.Coyote.SystematicTesting.Test]
  public static async Task TestConcurrentCounter() {
      var counter = new Counter();
      
      var t1 = Task.Run(() => counter.Increment());
      var t2 = Task.Run(() => counter.Increment());
      
      await Task.WhenAll(t1, t2);
      
      Assert.AreEqual(2, counter.Value);
  }
  
  // Coyote explores all possible thread interleavings
  ```
  
  **DejaFu (Haskell):**
  ```
  testDejaFu :: IO ()
  testDejaFu = do
      results <- autocheck myFunction
      print results
  
  -- Tests all possible schedules, finds counterexamples
  ```
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Not using in CI**: Only testing locally
  - **Large state space**: Exponential interleavings
  - **False confidence**: Passing doesn't mean bug-free
  - **Tool limitations**: Can't explore all possibilities for large programs
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Use deterministic testing for critical concurrent algorithms
  - Combine with property-based testing for better coverage
  - Start with small concurrent units (not whole system)
  - Use as complement to race detectors, not replacement

- [ ] **Debug Concurrency Issues Systematically**
  - Add logging with happens-before ordering
  - Use happens-before visualization tools
  - Apply binary search to isolate race
  - Check synchronization at boundaries
  
  **Debugging Strategies:**
  
  **1. Logging with Logical Clocks:**
  ```
  type LogEntry struct {
      threadID  int
      timestamp int64  // Logical clock
      event     string
  }
  
  var logClock atomic.Int64
  
  func logEvent(threadID int, event string) {
      ts := logClock.Add(1)
      log.Printf("[T%d @ %d] %s", threadID, ts, event)
  }
  
  // Logs preserve happens-before ordering
  ```
  
  **2. Happens-Before Visualization:**
  ```
  Thread 1: ─────A───────B───────────C─────>
                  │        ╲          │
                  │         ╲         │ (happens-before)
  Thread 2: ──────┼──────────D────────E───>
                  │          │
  Channel/Lock: ══X══════════Y═════════>
  
  A → B → C (program order)
  D → E (program order)
  B → D (synchronization via X)
  ```
  
  **3. Binary Search to Isolate:**
  ```
  // Disable half of concurrent operations
  // If bug disappears, bug is in disabled half
  // If bug persists, bug is in enabled half
  // Repeat until minimal reproduction
  ```
  
  **Common Pitfalls:**
  - **Heisenbugs**: Bug disappears when debugging
  - **Non-reproducible**: Can't reliably trigger bug
  - **Too much logging**: Logging changes timing, hides bug
  - **Wrong tool**: Using sequential debugger for concurrent code
  
  **Pro Tips:**
  - Use rr (record-replay debugger) for deterministic replay
  - Add invariant assertions frequently
  - Use ThreadSanitizer output to identify racy variables
  - Draw happens-before diagrams on paper/whiteboard

**Red Flags in Phase 4:**
- 🚨 Not running race detector in CI
- 🚨 No property-based tests for concurrent code
- 🚨 Can't reproduce concurrency bugs reliably
- 🚨 No systematic testing strategy
- 🚨 Only testing happy path
- 🚨 No invariant checking in tests

### Meta-Checklist: How to Use This Rubric

- **For New Concurrent Code**: Work through Phases 0→1→2→3→4 in order
- **For Code Review**: Check against Phase 0 (model choice) and Phase 1 (synchronization)
- **For Debugging**: Use Phase 2 (happens-before) and Phase 4 (systematic debugging)
- **For Optimization**: Consider Phase 3 (lock-free) only after profiling shows lock contention
- **Frequency**:
  - Phase 0: Once per project (choose concurrency model)
  - Phase 1: Every concurrent data structure or algorithm
  - Phase 2: When adding shared state or synchronization
  - Phase 3: Rarely (only for proven scalability bottlenecks)
  - Phase 4: Continuously (every commit with race detector)

**Remember**: "Concurrent programming is hard. The only way to get it right is to understand your memory model, use the right synchronization primitives, and test exhaustively."

**Success = Concurrent code that:**
- ✅ Uses appropriate concurrency model for the problem
- ✅ Has clear synchronization points and ownership
- ✅ Passes race detector with no warnings
- ✅ Has property-based and deterministic tests
- ✅ Is documented with thread-safety guarantees
- ✅ Uses high-level primitives (not hand-rolled synchronization)
