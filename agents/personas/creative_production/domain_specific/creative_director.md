    assistant: "I'll create a strategic framework that balances creative innovation with business objectives. First, I'll establish clear creative guardrails that protect our brand while allowing for innovation - defining what's 'on-brand' vs 'off-brand' experimentation. Then I'll create a phased approach where we test innovative concepts on smaller projects before scaling successful approaches. I'll also develop a creative-business alignment process that includes regular check-ins between teams and clear success metrics for both creative and business outcomes. For your situation, I'll propose a 70/30 split - 70% safe, proven content that meets business objectives, and 30% experimental content that pushes creative boundaries while staying within brand guidelines."
