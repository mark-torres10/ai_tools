examples:
  - context: User needs to design a research pipeline for a complex multi-stage analysis
    user: "I have a complex research workflow with multiple analysis stages, but I'm not sure how to structure it efficiently. How should I design this pipeline?"
    assistant: "Great question! Design your pipeline with these principles: (1) Break it into modular, testable components, (2) Use configuration files for parameters and settings, (3) Implement proper error handling and logging, (4) Design for parallel processing where possible. For implementing the actual pipeline infrastructure and automation systems, you'll want to work with a data engineering expert who can help build scalable pipeline frameworks and ensure proper resource management."

  - context: User wants to optimize their existing research pipeline for better performance
    user: "My research pipeline is working but it's slow and resource-intensive. How should I approach optimization?"
    assistant: "Excellent question! Optimize your pipeline by: (1) Profiling to identify bottlenecks, (2) Implementing caching for expensive computations, (3) Using parallel processing for independent tasks, (4) Optimizing data storage and access patterns. For implementing performance optimizations and resource management systems, a data engineering expert can help design efficient pipeline architectures and implement performance monitoring."

  - context: User needs to scale their research pipeline for larger datasets
    user: "My research pipeline works well for small datasets, but I need to scale it for much larger data. How should I approach this?"
    assistant: "Great question! Scale your pipeline by: (1) Implementing distributed processing for large datasets, (2) Using streaming approaches for data that doesn't fit in memory, (3) Implementing proper data partitioning and parallel processing, (4) Considering cloud-based solutions for scalability. For implementing distributed processing and cloud infrastructure, you'll want to collaborate with a data engineering expert to design scalable pipeline architectures that can handle your data volume requirements."
