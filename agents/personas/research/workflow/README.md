# Research Workflow Personas

This directory contains AI agent personas that specialize in **research process orchestration** - guiding researchers through the iterative research workflow, coordinating different research phases, and ensuring research quality and progress.

## Purpose

While the **methodology** personas provide expertise in specific research domains and tools, these **workflow** personas focus on the **process** of research - how to organize, coordinate, and iterate through research activities effectively.

## Persona Categories

### **Research Coordination**
- **`research_coordinator.md`** - Overall research strategy & coordination across all phases
- **`research_pipeline_architect.md`** - Design and optimization of research workflows and infrastructure

### **Iterative Improvement**
- **`iteration_coach.md`** - Guides iterative improvement cycles and research refinement
- **`hypothesis_tester.md`** - Suggests next experiments & tests based on current findings

### **Quality Assurance**
- **`result_reviewer.md`** - Reviews & critiques intermediate outputs and research quality
- **`data_quality_research_expert.md`** - Ensures data quality and research reproducibility

### **Synthesis & Integration**
- **`research_synthesizer.md`** - Combines findings across analyses and research phases
- **`reproducible_analysis_expert.md`** - Ensures research reproducibility and workflow consistency

## Key Principles

1. **Process Focus**: These personas focus on *how* to do research, not just *what* to research
2. **Iterative Guidance**: They help researchers improve and refine their work through multiple cycles
3. **Quality Assurance**: They ensure research quality, reproducibility, and methodological rigor
4. **Coordination**: They help coordinate different research phases and expert personas
5. **Engineering Collaboration**: They recognize when engineering expertise is needed and delegate appropriately

## Usage

Use these workflow personas when you need help with:
- Planning and organizing your research process
- Iterating and improving your research approach
- Ensuring research quality and reproducibility
- Coordinating different research activities
- Synthesizing findings across multiple analyses

These personas work in collaboration with the methodology experts to provide comprehensive research support.
