# üß≠ Agent Persona Router

This folder contains specialized AI agents designed to assist with various research workflow tasks across the entire research lifecycle, from initial planning through final synthesis and review.

Use this file to decide which agent persona is best suited for a task or research workflow need. If no persona is a good fit, consider creating a new one using `create_persona.md`.

## üìå Routing Guidelines

To determine which persona to use:

1. **Look for focus area overlap** between your research workflow need and the persona's expertise
2. **Check if your task resembles** any of the example tasks listed
3. **Consider the research stage** you're in (planning, execution, analysis, synthesis, review)
4. **If the task requires multiple domains**, select multiple personas
5. **If no persona matches**, return:
   > **No matching persona found. Consider defining a new one.**

## Notes

- Each persona focuses on specific aspects of research workflow while recognizing when engineering expertise is needed for implementation
- Personas are designed to collaborate with data engineering experts for technical implementation
- Focus on methodological guidance and workflow design rather than technical execution
- All personas maintain awareness of research stage and context for appropriate recommendations
