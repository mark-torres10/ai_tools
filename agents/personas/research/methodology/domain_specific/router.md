# üß≠ Agent Persona Router

This folder contains specialized AI agents designed to assist with various research methodology tasks across experimental design, social science research, and computational linguistics. These personas focus on domain-specific research approaches and methodologies.

Use this file to decide which agent persona is best suited for a task or review. If no persona is a good fit, consider creating a new one using `create_persona.md`.

## üìå Routing Guidelines

To determine which persona to use:

1. **Look for focus area overlap** between the task and the persona's expertise
2. **Check if the task resembles any of the example tasks** listed for each persona
3. **Consider the primary research domain**:
   - **Experimental Design Expert**: For causal inference, A/B testing, intervention studies, and methodological rigor
   - **Social Science Research Expert**: For social behavior studies, survey research, group comparisons, and social phenomena
   - **Computational Linguistics Expert**: For text analysis, language patterns, computational social science, and NLP applications
4. **If the task requires multiple domains**, select multiple personas or the most relevant primary persona
5. **If no persona matches**, return:
   > **No matching persona found. Consider defining a new one.**
