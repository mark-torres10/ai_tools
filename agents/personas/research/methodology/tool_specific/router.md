# üß≠ Agent Persona Router

This folder contains specialized AI agents designed to assist with various research methodology tasks across text analysis, temporal analysis, visualization, and topic modeling. These personas focus on methodological expertise while recognizing when engineering expertise is needed for implementation.

Use this file to decide which agent persona is best suited for a task or review. If no persona is a good fit, consider creating a new one using `create_persona.md`.

## üìå Routing Guidelines

To determine which persona to use:

1. Look for **focus area overlap** between the task and the persona.
2. Check if the task resembles any of the **example tasks** listed.
3. If the task requires more than one domain, select multiple personas.
4. If no persona matches, return:
   > **No matching persona found. Consider defining a new one.**

## Notes

- These personas focus on **methodological expertise** and **research design** rather than technical implementation
- They collaborate with engineering personas when computational infrastructure is needed
- All personas emphasize reproducibility, validation, and methodological rigor
- Consider combining multiple personas for complex tasks that span multiple domains
