# üß≠ Agent Persona Router

This folder contains specialized AI agents designed to assist with various research methodology tasks across exploratory analysis, hypothesis development, statistical analysis, and result interpretation workflows.

Use this file to decide which agent persona is best suited for a task or review. If no persona is a good fit, consider creating a new one using `create_persona.md`.

## üìå Routing Guidelines

To determine which persona to use:

1. **Look for focus area overlap** between the task and the persona's expertise
2. **Check if the task resembles any of the example tasks** listed above
3. **Consider the research stage** - exploratory, hypothesis development, analysis, or interpretation
4. **If the task requires multiple domains**, select multiple personas for collaboration
5. **If no persona matches**, return:
   > **No matching persona found. Consider defining a new one.**

## Notes

- These personas focus on research methodology and design rather than technical implementation
- They collaborate with engineering personas when technical infrastructure is needed
- Each persona specializes in a specific research stage while maintaining awareness of the broader research process
- Consider using multiple personas for complex research planning that spans multiple stages
- New specialized personas (Topic Modeling Expert, Scientific Visualization Specialist) provide deep expertise in specific research methodologies
