# Part 5b — Emotional Arc Fundamentals (Beat Mapping)

In Part 5a we set the principles: emotions = SLOs.  
Now we’ll **map specific emotions to each beat** and ensure they build in the right sequence.

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Part
- Assign a **primary emotion** and **secondary emotion** to each beat.  
- Ensure the emotional arc builds progressively.  
- Avoid tonal whiplash or redundancy.

## 🧩 Beat-to-Emotion Mapping

### 1. Hook (0–5s)
- **Primary Emotion:** Curiosity  
- **Secondary Emotion:** Recognition  
- *Why:* Sets up the problem. Viewer must instantly feel: *“I’ve been there.”*

### 2. Reveal (5–12s)
- **Primary Emotion:** Surprise  
- **Secondary Emotion:** Delight  
- *Why:* Introduces the solution. Must feel novel + fun, not obvious or expected.

### 3. Sports Use Case (12–20s)
- **Primary Emotion:** Trust  
- **Secondary Emotion:** Excitement  
- *Why:* Demonstrates credibility. Viewer thinks: *“Okay, it actually works.”*

### 4. Shopping/Beauty Use Case (20–28s)
- **Primary Emotion:** Relatability  
- **Secondary Emotion:** Delight  
- *Why:* Makes it personal. Viewer feels: *“That’s me, I’d use this.”*

### 5. Gaming/News Use Case (28–36s)
- **Primary Emotion:** Playfulness  
- **Secondary Emotion:** Credibility  
- *Why:* Adds fun, insider knowledge. Viewer thinks: *“It gets my world.”*

### 6. Marketplace Montage (36–48s)
- **Primary Emotion:** Possibility  
- **Secondary Emotion:** Empowerment  
- *Why:* Expands scale. Viewer feels: *“This isn’t just one niche, it’s big — I could be part of it.”*

### 7. Closing + CTA (48–60s)
- **Primary Emotion:** Inspiration  
- **Secondary Emotion:** Trust  
- *Why:* Locks in the vision. Viewer thinks: *“This feels important, I want in.”*

## ⚠️ Avoiding Pitfalls
- **Tonal Whiplash:** Don’t jump from somber → playful too abruptly. Use transitions to smooth emotional shifts.  
- **Redundancy:** Don’t repeat the same emotion across multiple beats without escalation (e.g., two “delight” beats in a row).  
- **Flatline:** Each beat must add something new; otherwise the arc feels stagnant.

## ✅ Output of This Step
You now have an **emotional map** aligned to your beats:  
- Each beat has a primary + secondary emotion.  
- Emotions progress logically (curiosity → surprise → trust → relatability → playfulness → possibility → inspiration).  
- Pitfalls identified to keep flow smooth.  

Next: in **Part 5c — Narrative Flow & Pacing (Timing Principles)**, we’ll translate this emotional arc into **time budgets and rhythm** for each beat.
