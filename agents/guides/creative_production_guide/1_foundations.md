# Part 1 — Mental Reframes (Foundations)

Since you’re an engineer, let’s first **translate the language of creative direction into engineering analogies**. This makes the work feel less “abstract art” and more like structured system design.

## 🎯 Goal of This Part
To reframe *creative direction* not as messy intuition but as a **system with components, constraints, and intended outputs** — just like engineering design. Once this foundation is clear, you’ll feel confident interrogating, iterating, and scaling the storyboard the same way you’d refine a technical spec.

## 🔄 Core Reframes

1. **Storyboard = System Architecture Diagram**  
   - At the highest level, the storyboard defines the “services” (shots) and how they interact (sequence, flow).  
   - Just like you wouldn’t implement before you have the architecture right, you don’t film/animate before nailing the storyboard.  

2. **Shot = Service / Component**  
   - Each shot has:  
     - **Purpose** (what problem it solves: e.g. deliver context, evoke excitement).  
     - **Inputs** (lines of dialogue, visuals, setting).  
     - **Outputs** (emotion, audience takeaway).  
     - **Constraints** (time budget: 5–8s, tone consistency).  

3. **Narrative Arc = System Behavior**  
   - How the audience moves emotionally across the trailer is like how a distributed system handles load:  
     - Intro (cold start, establish context).  
     - Build-up (warmup, throughput).  
     - Payoff (peak response, low latency).  
     - CTA (final output, success metric).  

4. **Transitions = API Contracts**  
   - How shots hand off to each other is just as important as the shots themselves.  
   - A bad cut = an unstable API, breaking the experience.  
   - Smooth transitions = reliable data flow, making the story feel seamless.  

5. **Emotion = SLO (Service Level Objective)**  
   - Every beat is designed to **guarantee** the audience feels something: curiosity, delight, trust.  
   - If the audience doesn’t feel it, the shot has “failed” its SLA.  

6. **Constraints = Non-Functional Requirements**  
   - Total length = < 60s.  
   - Each shot must be understandable standalone.  
   - Tone must be consistent across all shots.

## ⚙️ Mental Model Shift

- As an engineer, you’re used to thinking:  
  - *“What’s the throughput? What’s the latency? What are the failure modes?”*  
- As a creative director, you’ll think:  
  - *“What’s the pacing? What’s the emotional timing? What are the weak shots that break immersion?”*  

They’re the **same questions with different names**.

✅ That’s the foundational reframe: thinking of storyboarding as structured system design.
