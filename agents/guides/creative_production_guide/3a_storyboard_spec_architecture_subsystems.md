# Part 3a — Storyboard as Spec Architecture: Beats (Subsystems)

We’re now treating the storyboard like a **system architecture diagram**.  
This section focuses on **beats**, the high-level subsystems of the trailer.

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Part
To define the **beats** of the storyboard as the core “modules” of the trailer:  
- Each beat has a **narrative purpose** (what it must accomplish).  
- Each beat maps to a distinct **emotional outcome**.  
- Each beat serves as a **container** for multiple shots (components).

---

## 🧩 What Are Beats?
- **Analogy:** A *beat* in storytelling = a *subsystem* in architecture.  
- Just as subsystems deliver specific functions (auth, caching, storage), beats deliver specific *emotional and informational payloads*.  
- They ensure the story progresses logically while meeting timing and emotional constraints.

## 📊 Example Beats in Your Trailer

1. **Hook (Problem Introduction)**  
   - *Purpose:* Grab attention with a relatable frustration.  
   - *Emotional Outcome:* Audience feels curiosity + recognition.  
   - *Constraints:* Must land in <5 seconds.  

2. **Reveal (Solution Introduction)**  
   - *Purpose:* Introduce the avatar product as the “answer.”  
   - *Emotional Outcome:* Surprise + delight.  
   - *Constraints:* Quick visual clarity + memorable first impression.  

3. **Sports Use Case**  
   - *Purpose:* Demonstrate immediate value in a familiar domain.  
   - *Emotional Outcome:* Trust + excitement.  
   - *Constraints:* Must show clear before/after of problem → solution.  

4. **Shopping/Beauty Use Case**  
   - *Purpose:* Show personal utility beyond sports.  
   - *Emotional Outcome:* Relatability + delight.  
   - *Constraints:* Balance between lifestyle b-roll + UI overlay.  

5. **Gaming/News Use Case**  
   - *Purpose:* Show adaptability in another domain.  
   - *Emotional Outcome:* Playfulness + insider knowledge.  
   - *Constraints:* Needs to feel fast + credible.  

6. **Marketplace Montage**  
   - *Purpose:* Zoom out → show scale and opportunity for creators.  
   - *Emotional Outcome:* Empowerment + possibility.  
   - *Constraints:* Multi-avatar visuals + creator b-roll.  

7. **Closing + CTA**  
   - *Purpose:* Land the core message + direct action.  
   - *Emotional Outcome:* Trust + inspiration.  
   - *Constraints:* Minimal, polished, <8 seconds.

## ✅ Output of This Step
You now have a **map of beats** that act like **subsystems** in your trailer’s architecture.  
Each one has:
- **Purpose** (functional requirement).  
- **Emotional outcome** (non-functional requirement).  
- **Constraints** (timing, clarity).  

These become containers for shots (components), which we’ll define next in **Part 3b**.
