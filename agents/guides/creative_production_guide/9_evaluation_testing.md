# Part 9 — Evaluation & Testing

With iteration and versioning in place, we now formalize **evaluation and testing** at the trailer level.  
This is like running **system-level QA + performance testing** for your full product.

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Part
- Define how to test the trailer as a whole (not just shot-level).  
- Ensure the emotional arc, pacing, and clarity work end-to-end.  
- Tie creative QA to business goals (e.g., waitlist conversions).

---

## 🧩 Evaluation Layers

### 1. **Technical QA**
- Ensure all shots integrate correctly (no glitches).  
- Check transitions, audio sync, subtitle alignment.  
- Verify export formats (16:9 hero, 9:16 vertical).  

### 2. **Narrative QA**
- Watch for coherence: does the story flow logically?  
- Spot gaps or redundancies.  
- Verify the emotional arc matches mapped SLOs.  

### 3. **Audience QA**
- **Small test screenings** (5–10 target users).  
- Ask:  
  - What did you understand?  
  - How did you feel at each point?  
  - Would you click “Join the waitlist”?  

### 4. **AI-Assisted QA**
- Run transcript through sentiment/emotion classifier.  
- Have an LLM summarize each beat.  
  - Check if output matches intended purpose.  
- Use AI to flag pacing issues (e.g., long VO, rapid cuts).

## 📊 Success Metrics

- **Attention Retention:** % of viewers who stay through 60s.  
- **Comprehension:** % who can explain product concept in <20 words.  
- **Emotional Accuracy:** % who report intended emotions at each beat.  
- **Conversion:** % who click “Join waitlist.”  

---

## 🔁 Testing Workflow
1. Export draft cut.  
2. Run technical + AI QA.  
3. Show to test viewers.  
4. Collect structured feedback.  
5. Adjust pacing, VO, or transitions.  
6. Re-test until metrics are stable.

## 📋 Example Test Outcome
- **Version:** v2.3 Beta Cut  
- **Findings:**  
  - Marketplace beat felt cluttered.  
  - Test users missed “creator earns” message.  
- **Fix:**  
  - Simplify overlays, add narrator VO line.  
- **Result v2.4:**  
  - Viewers said: “Oh, creators make money too.”  
  - Conversion intent ↑ 18%.

## ✅ Output of This Step
- Trailer QA is now **structured and measurable.**  
- Testing spans technical, narrative, audience, and AI layers.  
- Success tied to **business outcomes** (waitlist signups).  

Next: in **Part 10 — Final Assembly & Delivery**, we’ll define how to package, export, and ship the trailer across formats and channels.
