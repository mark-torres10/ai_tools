# Part 10 — Final Assembly & Delivery

We’ve designed, specced, tested, and iterated the trailer.  
The final step is **assembly and delivery** — like deploying a system into production.

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Part
- Define the final assembly workflow.  
- Standardize exports for different platforms.  
- Ensure delivery is reliable, polished, and measurable.

## 🧩 Assembly Workflow

1. **Timeline Lock**
   - Confirm all shots are approved (acceptance tests passed).  
   - Lock storyboard (v3.0).  

2. **Final Editing**
   - Import all assets into CapCut/Premiere.  
   - Place VO, b-roll, UI overlays, transitions.  
   - Sync music + SFX.  

3. **Polish Pass**
   - Color correction + consistent look.  
   - Audio mastering (LUFS -14 to -16).  
   - Typography alignment + caption QA.

## 📦 Export Strategy

### 1. **Master Export**
- Format: 1920x1080, ProRes/MP4.  
- Length: 60s.  
- Use as archive + source for other formats.  

### 2. **Platform Versions**
- **Website Hero:** 16:9, muted autoplay, with captions.  
- **Social (TikTok, IG Reels, YT Shorts):** 9:16 vertical crop, max impact visuals, hardcoded captions.  
- **Investor Deck:** GIF or silent loop version.  

### 3. **Accessibility**
- Subtitles/captions in `.srt` and `.vtt`.  
- Transcript file for VO.  
- Optional descriptive audio version.

## 📊 Delivery Metrics

- Track via landing page + analytics:  
  - Views → Completions → Clicks on “Join waitlist.”  
- Measure retention curve: where do drop-offs occur?  
- Run A/B tests:  
  - Apple-polished cut vs. Creator-energy cut.  
  - CTA phrasing variants.  

---

## ✅ Output of This Step
- Trailer is fully assembled, polished, and exported in multiple formats.  
- Delivery is optimized for website, social, and presentations.  
- Conversion tracking closes the loop: you measure the trailer’s business impact.
