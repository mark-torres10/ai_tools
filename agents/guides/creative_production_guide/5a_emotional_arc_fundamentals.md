# Part 5a — Emotional Arc Fundamentals (Principles)

We now zoom out from shots and scenes to the **emotional system behavior** of the trailer.  
This part covers why emotions are the *SLOs* of storytelling, and how to think about them as constraints and guarantees.

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Part
- Reframe emotions as the **service-level objectives (SLOs)** of the trailer.  
- Understand the distinction between **narrative logic** (events that happen) and **emotional logic** (how it feels).  
- Identify the **core emotional beats** your trailer must hit.

---

## 🧩 Emotions as SLOs
- In engineering: SLO = *“99% of requests under 200ms.”*  
- In storytelling: SLO = *“Audience must feel curiosity in first 5s, delight by 20s, trust by 40s.”*  
- Just like uptime, emotions are **non-negotiable guarantees**.  
- If a beat doesn’t deliver its emotion, the whole system feels unreliable.

---

## 🔀 Narrative vs. Emotional Logic
- **Narrative Logic:** The sequence of events (fan asks a question → avatar replies → payoff delivered).  
- **Emotional Logic:** The journey of feelings (confusion → curiosity → surprise → trust).  

Key insight:  
- Audiences don’t remember every line.  
- They remember **how it made them feel** at each stage.  
- Your “system performance” is measured in emotions, not raw events.

## ❤️ Core Emotional Beats (for your trailer)
- **Hook (0–5s):** Curiosity + recognition. *“That’s me, I’ve felt that.”*  
- **Reveal (5–12s):** Surprise + delight. *“Oh, that’s new!”*  
- **Sports Use Case (12–20s):** Trust + excitement. *“It actually works.”*  
- **Shopping Use Case (20–28s):** Relatability + delight. *“That’s useful for me.”*  
- **Gaming Use Case (28–36s):** Playfulness + credibility. *“This thing gets me.”*  
- **Marketplace (36–48s):** Possibility + empowerment. *“This could scale, I can be part of it.”*  
- **Closing CTA (48–60s):** Inspiration + trust. *“This feels big, I want in.”*

## ✅ Output of This Step
You now have the **principles** for treating emotions as measurable outputs:  
- Emotions = SLOs.  
- Narrative vs. emotional logic must both work, but emotions are the true KPI.  
- Core emotional beats defined for each stage of your trailer.  

Next: in **Part 5b — Emotional Arc Fundamentals (Beat Mapping)**, we’ll map specific emotions to each beat and ensure they build in the right sequence without redundancy or tonal whiplash.
