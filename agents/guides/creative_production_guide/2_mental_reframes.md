# Part 2 — Mental Reframes (Workflow & Questions)

In Part 1 we reframed creative direction as system design.  
Now we’ll break down **how to interrogate a storyboard** the same way you interrogate a technical spec.

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Part
To equip you with a **checklist and question framework** for analyzing, refining, and validating a storyboard.  
This turns “gut feel” creative review into a structured design review.

---

## 🧩 Core Analogy
- **Storyboard review = Design review.**
- You’re not asking “is this pretty?” but “does this satisfy the requirements, constraints, and integration points?”

---

## 📝 Checklist of Questions (per level)

### 1. **At the Storyboard Level (System Architecture)**
- What is the *core promise* of this trailer? (single big idea, like system’s core function)  
- Does the emotional arc build logically? (intro → build → payoff → CTA)  
- Are any beats redundant or missing? (like unused services in an arch diagram)  
- Does the total flow fit within time constraints (<60s)?  

### 2. **At the Shot Level (Component Spec)**
- What’s the **purpose** of this shot? (what problem does it solve in the arc?)  
- What’s the **input**? (script line, context, action)  
- What’s the **output**? (emotion, key info delivered, audience response)  
- Does it have clear **constraints**? (duration, style, tone)  
- How will it **fail** if poorly executed? (e.g., emotion doesn’t land, pacing breaks)  

### 3. **At the Transition Level (API Contracts)**
- How does the previous shot hand off to this one?  
- Is the cut jarring or smooth? (does the “interface” break immersion?)  
- Does the pacing between shots maintain flow?  

### 4. **At the System Behavior Level (Narrative Arc)**
- Are we achieving the required emotional SLOs?  
  - Curiosity at start?  
  - Surprise/delight mid-way?  
  - Trust/inspiration at the end?  
- Are there bottlenecks (slow moments that drag)?  
- Are there overloads (too much happening to process)?

## 🧠 Mental Model Shift
- Engineering review: *“Does this meet functional and non-functional requirements?”*  
- Creative review: *“Does this deliver required emotions and flow under given constraints?”*

## ✅ Output of This Step
When you interrogate a storyboard with these questions, you produce a **refined spec**:  
- You identify weak shots (like unstable services).  
- You clarify integration gaps (awkward transitions).  
- You validate flow against objectives (arc + time budget).  

This becomes the equivalent of a **PRD with acceptance criteria** for your trailer.
