# Part 4b — Component Spec for Each Shot: Purpose & Success Criteria

Now that we have a schema template, the next step is to clarify how to define the **purpose** and **success criteria** for each shot.  
This is equivalent to specifying the **functional requirements** and **acceptance tests** for a service in system design.

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Part
- Ensure every shot has a clearly defined **narrative role**.  
- Translate that role into **success outcomes**: what the audience should feel and take away.  
- Make these outcomes **measurable** so we can evaluate if the shot works.

---

## 🧩 Purpose (Functional Requirement)
The **purpose** answers: *Why does this shot exist?*  

- **Narrative Function:** What job it performs in the arc.  
- **Setup vs. Payoff:** Whether it introduces a problem, delivers a solution, or bridges.  
- **Unique Contribution:** What would break if this shot were removed.  

Examples:  
- Hook shot → *Show relatable frustration to pull audience in.*  
- Avatar shot → *Deliver instant context as payoff.*  
- Montage shot → *Convey breadth of use cases.*

## 📊 Success Criteria (Acceptance Tests)
Every shot should have **success criteria**—like SLOs for emotion + comprehension.  
Criteria should be:
- **Observable** (audience can describe what happened).  
- **Measurable** (within time, clarity, or comprehension bounds).  
- **Aligned** (supports the beat’s purpose, not distracting).  

### Example Types of Criteria
- **Clarity:** Viewer can summarize what happened in one sentence.  
- **Emotion:** Viewer reports feeling curiosity/delight/inspiration.  
- **Timing:** Shot length stays within 2–5s budget.  
- **Comprehension:** Info is retained (e.g., can recall discount code, game stat).

## 📋 Example Shot Spec

**Shot ID:** Sports-2 (Avatar Reply)  
- **Purpose:** Deliver instant value by explaining why the score turned out as it did.  
- **Success Criteria:**  
  - Audience understands the core fact (“bench outscored 42–18”).  
  - Viewer feels surprise + delight at getting quick clarity.  
  - Shot runs 2–3s max.  
  - VO line is <12 words for easy comprehension.  

---

## ✅ Output of This Step
You now know how to:
- Define each shot’s **purpose** (why it exists).  
- Define its **success criteria** (what it must accomplish emotionally and cognitively).  
- Treat each shot like a component with functional + non-functional requirements.  

Next: in **Part 4c — Inputs (Script, Visuals, Audio)**, we’ll specify the building blocks each shot needs and how to capture them.
