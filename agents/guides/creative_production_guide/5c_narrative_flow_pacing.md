# Part 5c — Narrative Flow & Pacing (Timing Principles)

With emotions mapped to beats, the next step is to define **timing principles**.  
This is like setting **latency and throughput targets** for your storytelling system.

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Part
- Establish **time budgets** for each beat.  
- Define the rhythm of shots within beats.  
- Ensure overall pacing supports the emotional arc.

---

## 🧩 Time Budgets (per Beat)
- **Hook:** 0–5s  
  - Short, punchy, curiosity-driven.  
- **Reveal:** 5–12s  
  - Slightly longer to land the “aha” moment.  
- **Sports Use Case:** 12–20s  
  - Two quick shots: problem + payoff.  
- **Shopping Use Case:** 20–28s  
  - Balanced lifestyle pacing, 2–3s each shot.  
- **Gaming Use Case:** 28–36s  
  - Fast, energetic, gamer-style editing.  
- **Marketplace Montage:** 36–48s  
  - Rapid cuts, multiple mini-shots.  
- **Closing + CTA:** 48–60s  
  - Slow down slightly to land inspiration.

**Rule of Thumb:** No single beat should exceed ~10s.  
The whole trailer must stay under 60s.

## ⏱️ Shot Durations
- **Individual Shot Target:** 2–4s.  
- **Setup + Payoff Pair:** 6–8s.  
- **Montage Shots:** 1–2s each.  
- **CTA Shot:** 5–7s (longest single shot).  

**Principle:** Short enough to keep momentum, long enough to be clear.

---

## 🎵 Rhythm Principles
- **Hook:** Start strong, immediate VO or action.  
- **Middle Use Cases:** Alternating rhythm (setup → payoff, repeat).  
- **Montage:** Rapid-fire, snappy cuts synced to music.  
- **Closing:** Slow down, steady VO, music swell.  

Think of this like a performance profile:  
- Cold start → warmup throughput → sustained peak → graceful shutdown.

## ✅ Output of This Step
You now have **time budgets and rhythm principles** for the trailer:  
- Beats constrained by seconds.  
- Shots given target durations.  
- Rhythm mapped to emotional flow.  

Next: in **Part 5d — Narrative Flow & Pacing (Flow Management)**, we’ll cover **how to detect and fix bottlenecks or overloads** in pacing.
