# Part 5e — Testing the Emotional System

Now that the emotional arc and pacing are defined, the final step is to **test the system**.  
This is like running **load tests and integration tests** to ensure the trailer behaves as intended under real conditions.

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Part
- Evaluate whether each beat delivers its intended emotion.  
- Gather structured feedback from **humans** and **AI reviewers**.  
- Iterate through tightening, trimming, or reordering until stable.

## 🧩 Testing Methods

### 1. Human Review
- **Micro-screenings:** Show draft cuts to 3–5 people (ideally your target audience).  
- Ask them to describe:  
  - What happened in each beat.  
  - How they felt at each moment.  
- **Success:** If their answers match your mapped emotional SLOs.  

### 2. AI Review
- **Emotion tagging:** Use an AI tool (e.g., sentiment classifier, multimodal LLM) to analyze each beat.  
  - Input: draft video with transcript.  
  - Output: predicted emotion tags + pacing notes.  
- **Comprehension check:** Ask AI: *“What’s the main point of this beat?”*  
  - If answer ≠ intended takeaway → beat failed.  

### 3. Telemetry Checks
- Validate quantitative metrics:  
  - Shot duration vs. constraint.  
  - VO pacing (WPM).  
  - Audio loudness (LUFS).  
  - Subtitle length.  
- Automate these as part of your “QA pipeline.”

## 🔁 Iteration Strategies
- **Tightening:** Trim VO or b-roll if beats drag.  
- **Trimming:** Remove redundant shots.  
- **Reordering:** Change sequence to improve buildup.  
- **Rescripting:** Rewrite VO to simplify or punch up emotion.

## 📋 Example Test Cycle
- Draft v1 shown to test group:  
  - Feedback: “Marketplace felt cluttered, didn’t catch the creator message.”  
- Fix: Split montage into 2 shorter beats with simpler overlays.  
- Draft v2: Reviewers now report “Felt big and possible, I’d sign up.”  
- Result: Emotional SLO achieved.

## ✅ Output of This Step
You now have a framework for **testing the emotional system**:  
- Human review for subjective validation.  
- AI review for scalable, objective checks.  
- Telemetry checks for hard constraints.  
- Iteration strategies for fixing weak beats.  

This ensures your trailer isn’t just produced — it’s **reliably delivering the intended emotions** like a system meeting its SLOs.
