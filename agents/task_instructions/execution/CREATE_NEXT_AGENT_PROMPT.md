# ü§ñ Create Next Agent Prompt

This prompt is designed to generate a comprehensive prompt for the next agent in the workflow, incorporating the current Linear ticket context and any relevant information from the current conversation.

---

## üéØ Purpose

When you reach the end of a ticket implementation, use this prompt to create a detailed, contextual prompt for the next agent. This ensures seamless handoff and maintains project continuity by providing all necessary context, requirements, and implementation details.

## üîÑ Usage Instructions

### When to Use This Prompt

1. **Ticket Completion**: After successfully implementing a ticket and before moving to the next one
2. **Handoff Scenarios**: When transferring work between different agents or team members
3. **Context Preservation**: When you want to ensure all relevant context is passed forward
4. **Project Continuity**: To maintain consistency across multiple ticket implementations

### How to Use

1. **Fill in the Template**: Replace all `[INSERT_...]` placeholders with actual values
2. **Gather Context**: Collect all relevant information from:
   - Current Linear ticket details
   - Previous ticket implementation
   - Current conversation insights
   - Codebase changes made
3. **Customize as Needed**: Add or remove sections based on project-specific requirements
4. **Validate Completeness**: Ensure all critical information is included
5. **Pass to Next Agent**: Use this prompt with the next agent in your workflow

### Information Sources

- **Linear Ticket**: Use Linear MCP to fetch complete ticket details
- **Git History**: Check recent commits and branch status
- **Project README**: Always reference the project's README.md for context
- **Current Conversation**: Extract relevant insights and decisions
- **Codebase State**: Document any significant changes or patterns established

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Be Comprehensive**: Include all relevant context, even if it seems obvious
2. **Be Specific**: Use concrete examples and file paths rather than general descriptions
3. **Be Consistent**: Follow the established patterns and conventions
4. **Be Proactive**: Anticipate questions the next agent might have
5. **Be Honest**: Document any challenges, uncertainties, or incomplete work
6. **Be Organized**: Structure the information logically and clearly

This prompt ensures that each agent has the complete context needed to continue the project effectively and maintain high-quality implementation standards.
