# 🚀 How to Execute a Linear Ticket

This document provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for executing Linear tickets from initial analysis through implementation to PR creation and completion. This process ensures high-quality, test-driven development that follows all established coding standards, project management workflows, and GitHub operations protocols.

## 🏃 Runner SOP (Adherence-first)

Use this section as the strict, minimal checklist for agents and CI. The detailed sections below remain the reference.

### Adherence Block (must be echoed at top of each turn)
```json
{"step_id":"<1..14>","checklist_completed":[],"artifacts_written":[],"blockers":[],"awaiting_approval":false}
```

### Entry Criteria (before Step 3)
- Feature branch exists and environment configured
- Dependencies validated (blocking tickets resolved or escalated)
- `projects/<date>_<name>/spec.md` and `braindump.md` ingested
- Execution plan approved by user

### Minimal Steps + Gates
1. Analyze ticket & gather context → Gate: plan approval required
2. Implementation planning → Gate: APPROVED PLAN
3. Dev setup (branch/env)
4. TDD (write tests first)
5. Implementation (quality rules)
6. Testing & validation → Gate: SPEC COMPLIANCE PASSED
7. Comprehensive testing (optional but recommended) → Gate: Testing report linked
8. Incremental commits (convention)
9. Code review prep (architecture/context packages)
10. PR creation (template + links)
11. PR management (address feedback)
12. Completion & cleanup (update artifacts)
13. Post-completion tasks (lessons, metrics)
14. Agent retrospective (retrospective/{ticket}.md)

Per step triad:
- Action: …
- Evidence: …
- Artifact: …
- Gate (if any): …

## 📋 Pre-Execution Phase

### 1. **Ticket Analysis & Context Gathering**

#### Retrieve Ticket Information
- Use the Linear MCP to fetch the complete ticket details by ID
- Extract all required information:
  - **Title**: The specific task to be implemented
  - **Context & Motivation**: Business goals and user stories
  - **Detailed Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements
  - **Success Criteria**: Definition of "done"
  - **Test Plan**: Required test cases and coverage
  - **Dependencies**: Blocking tickets and external requirements
  - **Suggested Implementation Plan**: High-level approach (if provided)

#### Gather Related Context
- **Review Related PRs**: Search for previous PRs related to the ticket's feature area
  - Use GitHub CLI: `gh pr list --search "<feature_keywords>"`
  - Analyze implementation patterns, code structure, and testing approaches
  - Note any architectural decisions or conventions established
- **Check Project Planning**: Review `/planning/<projectId_prefix>_<project_name>/plan_<feature>.md` for:
  - Overall project context and dependencies
  - Related subtasks and their status
  - Technical decisions and constraints
- **Examine Codebase**: Understand the current state of relevant files
  - Identify affected modules and components
  - Review existing patterns and conventions
  - Check for potential conflicts or refactoring needs

#### Ingest Spec and Brain Dump (Project Artifacts)
- Read `projects/<YYYY-MM-DD>_<project-name>/spec.md` to confirm scope, success criteria, and constraints.
- Skim `projects/<YYYY-MM-DD>_<project-name>/braindump.md` to recover early context and assumptions.
- If discrepancies with the Linear ticket exist, document them in `projects/<YYYY-MM-DD>_<project-name>/logs.md` and comment on the ticket with proposed resolution.

#### Validate Dependencies
- **Check Blocking Tickets**: Verify all dependencies are resolved
  - Use Linear MCP to check status of blocking tickets
  - If dependencies are incomplete, document blockers and escalate
- **External Dependencies**: Verify access to required services, APIs, or resources
- **Environment Setup**: Ensure development environment is properly configured per `CODING_REPO_CONVENTIONS.md`

### 2. **Implementation Planning**

#### Break Down the Task
- Decompose complex tickets into logical implementation steps
- Each step should be focused and testable
- Document steps in `projects/<YYYY-MM-DD>_<project-name>/plan_<feature>.md`

#### Sync with Tickets Folder
- Ensure an entry exists in `projects/<YYYY-MM-DD>_<project-name>/tickets/` for this ticket (or create one): `ticket-<id>.md`.
- Copy/align acceptance criteria from Linear into the ticket doc; keep it in sync during execution.
- Link the ticket doc in the Linear issue and later in the PR description.

#### Create Detailed Execution Plan
- Use `EXECUTION_PLANNING_PROMPT.md` to create comprehensive implementation plan
- Include code structure, organization, and technical approach
- Wait for explicit user approval before beginning implementation
- Ensure plan aligns with existing code patterns and conventions

#### Estimate Effort
- Use historical data from similar tasks
- Consider complexity, testing requirements, and integration needs
- Update Linear ticket with refined estimates if needed

#### Identify Risk Areas
- Highlight potential technical challenges
- Plan mitigation strategies for high-risk components
- Document assumptions and constraints

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Phase

### Daily Execution Loop (applies throughout Steps 3–7)
- Update `projects/<YYYY-MM-DD>_<project-name>/todo.md` with progress (check items completed today).
- Append a brief entry to `projects/<YYYY-MM-DD>_<project-name>/logs.md` (date, work done, blockers, key decisions).
- If plans change, update `projects/<YYYY-MM-DD>_<project-name>/plan_<feature>.md` to reflect the new sequence or scope.

### 3. **Development Setup**

#### Branch Creation
Follow `GITHUB_OPERATIONS.md` for branch naming and creation:
```bash
# Create feature branch with Linear issue prefix
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout -b feature/<issueId_prefix>_<feature_snippet>
```

YOU MUST ALWAYS CREATE A NEW BRANCH IF ONE DOESN'T EXIST. DO THIS before starting a ticket.

#### Environment Activation
- **Python Projects**: Activate conda environment (e.g., `conda activate bluesky-research`)
- **JavaScript Projects**: Install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install` (if needed).
- **Verify Setup**: Run existing tests to ensure environment is working (and work with the user to confirm in case tests don't pass, which might be OK depending on the setup).

### 4. **Test-Driven Development**

#### Write Tests First
Following `CODING_RULES.md` testing standards:
- **Unit Tests**: Write tests for each function/component before implementation
- **Integration Tests**: Test critical paths and component interactions
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for >90% line coverage, >80% branch coverage
- **Test Naming**: Use descriptive names that explain the scenario
- **Expected Results**: Write expected output to variables for clear assertions

#### Test Structure
```python
# Example test structure for Python
def test_feature_behavior():
    # Arrange
    input_data = {...}
    expected_result = {...}
    
    # Act
    actual_result = function_under_test(input_data)
    
    # Assert
    assert actual_result == expected_result
```

### 5. **Implementation**

#### Code Quality Standards
Follow `CODING_RULES.md` for all implementation:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function/class has one clear purpose
- **Type Hints**: All public APIs must have complete type annotations
- **Function Length**: Keep functions under 20 lines, methods under 50
- **Meaningful Names**: Variables and functions should be self-documenting
- **Early Returns**: Reduce nesting with guard clauses
- **Error Handling**: Fail fast with meaningful exceptions

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Core Logic**: Implement the main functionality
2. **Error Handling**: Add proper exception handling and validation
3. **Logging**: Implement structured logging with correlation IDs
4. **Documentation**: Add docstrings and inline comments
5. **Refactoring**: Clean up code and improve readability

#### Code Style Compliance
- Follow `CODING_REPO_CONVENTIONS.md`.

### 6. **Testing & Validation**

#### Run Test Suite
```bash
# Python with pytest
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src --cov-report=html

# JavaScript with Jest
npm test -- --coverage
```

#### Manual Testing
- Test all user flows and edge cases
- Verify error handling and validation
- Check performance characteristics
- Validate against success criteria

#### Integration Testing
- Test with real dependencies where possible
- Verify end-to-end functionality
- Check for regression issues

#### Spec Compliance
- Validate behavior against success criteria defined in `projects/<YYYY-MM-DD>_<project-name>/spec.md`.
- If criteria are ambiguous or unmet, log specifics in `projects/<YYYY-MM-DD>_<project-name>/logs.md` and propose updates to the spec or ticket for user approval.

### 7. **Comprehensive Testing & Experimentation**

## 🚩 Red Flags
- Proceeding without creating a new feature branch.
- No tests added or coverage below agreed threshold and not addressed.
- PR created without links to ticket doc, spec, or testing report.
- No validation against `spec.md` success criteria.
- Project artifacts (`todo.md`, `logs.md`, `lessons_learned.md`, `metrics.md`) not updated.
- Non-deterministic runs (missing seeds) for testable components.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- Drifting from `plan_<feature>.md` without updating the plan or logs.
- Not keeping `tickets/ticket-<id>.md` in sync with Linear acceptance criteria.
- Skipping negative controls or performance checks in testing.
- Forgetting to finalize timing metrics in `metrics.md`.
- Unclear branch naming or missing Linear links in commits/PR.

---

## 🚨 Error Handling & Recovery

### Debugging Process

When encountering bugs, errors, or implementation challenges, follow the systematic debugging approach outlined in `HOW_TO_DEBUG.md`. Follow that approach exactly.

#### When to Use Debugging Process
- **User Reports Bugs**: When the user reports specific errors or unexpected behavior
- **Repeated Failures**: When the same issue occurs multiple times during implementation
- **Test Failures**: When tests consistently fail and the root cause is unclear
- **Integration Issues**: When components don't work together as expected
- **Performance Problems**: When the implementation doesn't meet performance requirements

#### Integration with Ticket Execution
- Document debugging findings in the Linear ticket
- Update implementation plan based on root cause analysis
- Add debugging insights to `/planning/<projectId_prefix>_<project_name>/lessons_learned.md`
- Consider if the debugging reveals broader architectural or process improvements

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Implementation Challenges
- **Complex Requirements**: Break down into smaller subtasks
- **Technical Blockers**: Research alternatives or escalate to user
- **Performance Issues**: Profile and optimize critical paths
- **Integration Problems**: Mock dependencies for isolated testing

#### Git/GitHub Issues
- **Merge Conflicts**: Resolve locally and push updated commits
- **PR Problems**: Follow retry logic with exponential backoff

#### Linear Integration Issues
- **API Failures**: Retry with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- **Sync Problems**: Manually update Linear status if needed
- **Permission Issues**: Verify team access and escalate if needed

### Escalation Process
1. **Document the Issue**: Log in `/planning/<projectId_prefix>_<project_name>/logs.md`
2. **Research Solutions**: Check documentation and similar issues
3. **Propose Solution**: Present options to user with impact analysis
4. **Escalate if Needed**: Use template: `Error: <issue>. Impact: <effect>. Solution: <fix>. ETA: <time>.`
