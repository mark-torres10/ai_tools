# üé¨ Workflow: Create AI Video Prompts for Projects

## Overview
This workflow guides you through creating production-ready AI video prompts from initial brainstorming to final shot generation instructions. The process transforms freeform creative ideas into structured, executable prompts optimized for specific AI models.

## üìÅ Project Folder Structure
All AI video projects follow a consistent folder structure for organization and collaboration:

```
/projects
  /creative_{project_name}
    /storyboard
      - storyboard_sketches.md
      - visual_references.md
      - shot_sequence.md
    /shots
      - shot_001_prompt.md
      - shot_002_prompt.md
      - shot_003_prompt.md
      - [additional shot files]
    creative_production_braindump.md
    INSTRUCTIONS_SHOT_GENERATION.md
    project_brief.md
    brand_guidelines.md
```

**Folder Structure Guidelines:**
- **Project Name**: Use descriptive, kebab-case naming (e.g., `creative_product_launch_video`, `creative_brand_story_campaign`)
- **Storyboard Folder**: Contains visual planning documents, sketches, and reference materials
- **Shots Folder**: Individual shot prompt files for each scene or sequence
- **Root Files**: Main project documentation and workflow files
