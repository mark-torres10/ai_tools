# What makes a good AI video prompt?

## ‚úÖ As a Creative Director: 5 Criteria for Cinematic Excellence
These ensure your prompts produce visually compelling, story-driven content that resonates with audiences.

### Clear Visual Narrative
The prompt establishes a coherent story or emotional journey within the video. Instead of random elements, every detail serves the narrative purpose.

**‚úÖ PATTERNS TO FOLLOW:**
- **Character-driven storytelling**: "A weathered sea captain, his weathered hands gripping the ship's wheel, stares into the storm with determination as waves crash against the hull"
- **Emotional arc progression**: "The camera slowly pulls back from a close-up of tear-filled eyes to reveal a graduation ceremony, capturing the transition from personal emotion to collective celebration"
- **Symbolic visual elements**: "A single red balloon floats upward past a child's outstretched hand, symbolizing lost innocence against a grey urban backdrop"
- **Environmental storytelling**: "Empty coffee cups and scattered papers tell the story of an all-nighter as morning light streams through the window"

**‚ùå ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID:**
- **Random element collection**: "A dog, a car, a tree, and a person walking" (no narrative connection)
- **Generic action sequences**: "Someone running" (no context or purpose)

## ‚úÖ As a Technical AI Engineer: 5 Criteria for Model Optimization
These ensure the prompt works effectively with AI video generation models like Veo3, Runway Gen-4, Luma Dream Machine, and Pika 1.5.

### Structured Prompt Architecture
Follows a clear, consistent structure that AI models can parse effectively: Subject + Action + Setting + Camera + Lighting + Style + Audio.

**‚úÖ PATTERNS TO FOLLOW:**
- **Consistent element order**: Always start with subject, then action, setting, camera, lighting, style, audio
- **Clear section separators**: Use commas or periods to separate different prompt elements
- **Logical information flow**: Each element builds upon the previous one
- **Standardized terminology**: Use consistent terms across all prompts (e.g., always "dolly-in" not "zoom-in")
- **Modular structure**: Each section can be modified independently without affecting others

**‚ùå ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID:**
- **Random element order**: "Lighting, subject, camera, action" (confuses the model)
- **Missing separators**: "A woman walking in a park with good lighting" (unclear boundaries)
- **Inconsistent terminology**: "Zoom-in" in one prompt, "dolly-in" in another
- **Nested information**: "A woman (wearing blue) walking (slowly) in a park (with trees)" (confusing structure)
- **Mixed tenses**: "A woman walks and will be walking" (inconsistent verb forms)

**üé¨ EXAMPLE PROMPTS:**
- **Good**: "A woman walks in a park with good lighting"
- **Better**: "A 30-year-old woman with auburn hair, wearing a navy blazer, walks purposefully through a sunlit park with mature oak trees, shot with a slow dolly-in on a 35mm lens, lit by warm golden hour lighting with soft shadows, in a cinematic style with natural ambient sounds"

### Optimal Detail Density
Contains 60-100 words of rich, specific detail without overwhelming the model with conflicting or contradictory instructions.

**‚úÖ PATTERNS TO FOLLOW:**

- **Specific but not excessive**: Include key details without overloading (3-4 descriptive elements per subject)
- **Balanced information**: Equal weight to visual, technical, and atmospheric elements
- **Clear priorities**: Most important elements first, supporting details second
- **Concise language**: "Warm golden hour lighting" not "Very warm and beautiful golden hour lighting that is very nice"

**‚ùå ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID:**
- **Too sparse**: "A person walking" (insufficient detail)
- **Too dense**: "A 30-year-old woman with auburn hair, wearing a navy blazer, sitting at a modern glass desk, in a contemporary office with floor-to-ceiling windows, with warm LED lighting, walking purposefully, shot with a slow dolly-in, lit by golden hour lighting, in cinematic style" (overwhelming)
- **Conflicting details**: "Bright and dark lighting" (contradictory)
- **Redundant information**: "A woman, who is female, walks on her feet" (unnecessary repetition)
- **Vague specifics**: "Very good lighting" (not specific enough)

**üé¨ EXAMPLE PROMPTS:**
- **Good**: "A woman walks in a park with good lighting"
- **Better**: "A 30-year-old woman with auburn hair walks purposefully through a sunlit park, shot with a slow dolly-in on a 35mm lens, lit by warm golden hour lighting with soft shadows, in a cinematic style with natural ambient sounds"
