## üö´ Common Prompt Mistakes to Avoid

### Technical Mistakes
**‚ùå NEGATIVE PHRASING**
- **Bad**: "No clouds in the sky, no rain, no wind"
- **Good**: "Clear blue sky with gentle breeze"
- **Why**: AI models work better with positive descriptions

**‚ùå COMMAND-BASED LANGUAGE**
- **Bad**: "Add a product, make it shine, show the features"
- **Good**: "A sleek smartphone glistens in the warm light as the presenter highlights its innovative features"
- **Why**: AI models understand descriptive language better than commands

**‚ùå OVERLY CONCEPTUAL**
- **Bad**: "A person demonstrating digital innovation with technological consciousness"
- **Good**: "A confident presenter demonstrates smartphone features with clear, engaging explanations"
- **Why**: AI models need concrete, visual descriptions

### Structural Mistakes
**‚ùå TOO VAGUE**
- **Bad**: "A person showing a product"
- **Good**: "A confident professional demonstrates a sleek smartphone in a modern office setting"
- **Why**: Vague prompts lead to generic, uninteresting results

**‚ùå TOO COMPLEX**
- **Bad**: "A person in an office showing a product while it's raining and the sun is setting, with dramatic music playing, and they're talking on their phone, and there's a dog following them, and the camera is moving in multiple directions"
- **Good**: "A confident professional demonstrates a sleek smartphone in a modern office, shot with a slow dolly-in, lit by warm golden hour lighting"
- **Why**: Too many elements compete for attention and confuse the AI

**‚ùå INCONSISTENT STYLE**
- **Bad**: "A realistic person in an animated cartoon world with documentary-style lighting"
- **Good**: "A realistic person in a realistic office environment with cinematic lighting"
- **Why**: Conflicting styles create confusing, low-quality results

### Model-Specific Mistakes
**‚ùå IGNORING MODEL CAPABILITIES**
- **Bad**: "A person shows a product" (generic for all models)
- **Good for Veo3**: "A person demonstrates a product, her voice clear and confident as she explains each feature"
- **Why**: Each model has unique strengths that should be leveraged

**‚ùå GENERIC PROMPTS**
- **Bad**: Using the same prompt for Veo3, Runway, and Luma
- **Good**: Optimizing prompts for each model's specific capabilities
- **Why**: Different models excel at different aspects of video generation

## üéØ Model-Specific Optimization Strategies

### Veo3 Optimization
- **Structured JSON Format**: Must follow the comprehensive JSON structure with all sections (camera, environment, main_subject, lighting, animation, sound)
- **Rich Detail**: Use 200-300+ words minimum of specific, descriptive content
- **Leverage native audio generation**: Include specific dialogue, sound effects, and ambient audio with precise timing
- **Use image-to-video capabilities**: Upload reference images for character consistency and visual references
- **Focus on physics and movement**: Describe realistic, physics-based actions and environmental interactions
- **Professional cinematographic language**: Use specific camera terminology, lighting specifications, and technical details
- **Comprehensive shot integration**: Include ALL details from shot files in the structured prompt format
- **Audio-visual synchronization**: Ensure audio cues are precisely timed with visual elements
- **Environmental storytelling**: Include detailed atmospheric conditions, lighting effects, and environmental interactions
- **Character consistency**: Maintain detailed character descriptions and consistent visual elements
- **Technical precision**: Include specific lens specifications, aperture settings, color temperatures, and lighting setups

### Runway Gen-4 Optimization
- **Embrace simplicity**: Start with basic prompts and build complexity gradually
- **Use keyframe functionality**: Upload reference images for consistent characters
- **Focus on visual references**: Provide high-quality reference images
- **Clear, direct language**: Avoid overly complex descriptions

### Luma Dream Machine Optimization
- **Use natural language**: Conversational, descriptive tone
- **Leverage character reference system**: Upload consistent character images
- **Focus on cinematic movements**: Smooth, natural camera work
- **Emotional context**: Include feelings and atmosphere

### Pika 1.5 Optimization
- **Utilize motion effects**: Add dynamic movement and visual interest
- **Leverage lip sync capabilities**: Include clear dialogue for character speech
- **Use video-to-video transformations**: Transform existing content
- **Focus on motion and effects**: Emphasize dynamic visual elements

## üîÑ Iterative Refinement Process

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Start with basic scene description
2. Add core visual elements (subject, action, setting)
3. Test initial generation

### Phase 2: Enhancement
1. Add camera movement and composition
2. Include lighting and mood details
3. Test and refine

### Phase 3: Optimization
1. Add audio cues and color palette
2. Fine-tune technical specifications
3. Test final generation

### Phase 4: Scaling
1. Create variations for different use cases
2. Develop prompt templates for common scenarios
3. Document successful patterns and techniques
