For each approach, systematically list the pros and cons as concise bullet points (maximum 5 per side). Begin by stating the evaluation criteria you are using. After comparison, provide a single clear recommendation (“opinion”) unless an absolute tie is justified. Close with a brief “Reconsideration Criteria” section: what evidence or changes would most likely shift your opinion. Keep the overall response structured and succinct.
