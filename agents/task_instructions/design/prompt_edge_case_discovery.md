# üö® Edge Case Discovery Prompt

You are an elite quality assurance architect and resilience engineer tasked with uncovering potential failure points and edge cases in user flows before they become production bugs. Your mission is to prevent the common pitfall of designing only for ideal scenarios‚Äîa mistake that leads to fragile systems, user frustration, and costly post-launch fixes.

## üéØ Core Objective

Extract the user's flow design and systematically identify potential failure points, edge cases, and error scenarios that could break the user experience. Transform these insights into actionable error handling strategies that make the system robust and user-friendly.

## üö® The Happy Path Problem

**Warning**: Designing only for ideal user scenarios leads to:
- **Production bugs** that surface when real users encounter edge cases
- **Poor user experience** when flows break unexpectedly
- **High support costs** from users encountering unhandled errors
- **Development rework** when edge cases are discovered late in the process
- **User abandonment** when flows fail without clear recovery options

**Solution**: Proactively identify and design for edge cases early in the development process.

## üîç Edge Case Discovery Protocol

### 1. **Analyze Data Dependencies**
```text
What data is required for this flow? What happens if it's missing, invalid, or delayed?
```

### 2. **Identify User Behavior Variations**
```text
How might users deviate from the expected path? What if they skip steps or abandon mid-flow?
```

### 3. **Consider System Failures**
```text
What external systems or services does this flow depend on? What happens when they fail?
```

### 4. **Examine Environmental Factors**
```text
How does this flow behave with poor connectivity, slow devices, or different browsers?
```

### 5. **Map Error Recovery Paths**
```text
What should users see and be able to do when things go wrong?
```

### 6. **Validate Error Handling**
```text
Are error messages clear and actionable? Can users recover and continue their journey?
```

## üìã Actionable Prompt Templates

### Primary Edge Case Discovery Prompt

Use this comprehensive prompt to systematically uncover edge cases:

```
You are analyzing potential edge cases for the user flow: [INSERT FLOW DESCRIPTION].

**Flow Overview**: [Brief description of the user journey and expected outcome]

**Key Dependencies**: [List of data, services, or systems this flow depends on]

**Target Users**: [Who will use this flow and their technical proficiency]

Identify potential edge cases and failure points in the following categories:

1. **Data Issues**: Missing, invalid, corrupted, or delayed data
2. **User Behavior**: Unexpected actions, abandonment, or navigation
3. **System Failures**: Network issues, service outages, or performance problems
4. **Environmental Factors**: Device limitations, browser compatibility, or connectivity issues
5. **Business Logic**: Invalid states, conflicting rules, or edge conditions

For each identified edge case, specify:
- **Scenario**: What specific condition triggers this edge case?
- **Impact**: How does this affect the user experience?
- **Detection**: How can the system identify this condition?
- **Response**: What should the UI show and what actions should be available?
- **Recovery**: How can users continue their journey after encountering this issue?

**Priority**: Rate each edge case as High (breaks flow), Medium (degrades experience), or Low (minor inconvenience).
```

### Quick Edge Case Checklist

Use this rapid assessment prompt for quick validation:

```
Analyze this user flow for critical edge cases:

**Flow**: [Brief description]

**Quick Assessment**:
- What happens if required data is missing?
- What if the user abandons mid-flow?
- What if network connectivity is lost?
- What if the user has insufficient permissions?
- What if the system is under heavy load?

**Critical Issues**: List any edge cases that would completely break the user experience.
**Recovery Options**: What should users be able to do when these issues occur?
```

## üé® Usage Guidelines

### When to Use This Prompt
- **After mapping core user flows** but before detailed UI design
- **Before implementing any user-facing functionality**
- **When reviewing existing flows** that have user experience issues
- **During design reviews** to validate flow robustness
- **Before user testing** to prepare for real-world scenarios

### What This Prompt Delivers
- **Comprehensive edge case inventory** with impact assessment
- **Error handling strategies** for each identified scenario
- **User recovery paths** that maintain positive experience
- **Development priorities** for error handling implementation
- **Testing scenarios** for validation and quality assurance

### Integration with Design Process
1. **Use this prompt after flow mapping** to identify potential issues
2. **Design error states** alongside normal flow states
3. **Implement error handling** before launching features
4. **Test edge cases** during development and user testing
5. **Monitor and iterate** based on real user encounters

## üîç Example Usage

**Input**: "User flow for scheduling a team meeting with calendar integration"

**Prompt Application**:
```
You are analyzing potential edge cases for the user flow: Team meeting scheduling with calendar integration.

**Flow Overview**: User selects participants, chooses time slots, and creates calendar events

**Key Dependencies**: User permissions, calendar API, participant availability, network connectivity

**Target Users**: Team managers and assistants with varying technical skills

[Follow the comprehensive edge case analysis protocol above]
```

**Output**: Detailed edge case analysis including:
- Missing participant permissions
- Calendar API failures
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid time slot selections
- Conflicting meeting schedules

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

A successful edge case discovery should enable you to:
- **Design robust error handling** for all critical failure points
- **Create clear user recovery paths** that maintain positive experience
- **Prioritize development effort** based on impact and frequency
- **Reduce post-launch bugs** by addressing issues proactively
- **Improve user confidence** with clear error messaging and recovery options

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

After identifying edge cases:
1. **Design error states** for high-priority edge cases
2. **Implement error handling** with clear user messaging
3. **Create recovery flows** that help users continue their journey
4. **Test edge cases** during development and user testing
5. **Monitor real-world usage** to identify additional edge cases

Remember: **Edge cases are not edge cases for users**. What seems like an exception to developers is often a common occurrence for real users.

## üö´ Common Edge Cases to Always Consider

**Always analyze for these scenarios**:
- **Network failures** and connectivity issues
- **Missing or invalid user permissions**
- **Data validation failures** and format errors
- **Service timeouts** and performance degradation
- **User abandonment** and navigation away from flows
- **Browser compatibility** and device limitations
- **Concurrent user actions** and data conflicts
- **System maintenance** and scheduled downtime

**Never assume** users will follow the expected path or that systems will always be available.
