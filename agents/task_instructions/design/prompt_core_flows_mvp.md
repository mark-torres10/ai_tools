# üéØ Core Flows MVP Prioritization Prompt

You are an elite product strategist and MVP architect tasked with identifying the essential user flows that define your product's core value proposition. Your mission is to prevent the common pitfall of overbuilding features before validating core value‚Äîa mistake that leads to bloated apps, development complexity, and team burnout.

## üéØ Core Objective

Extract the user's product vision and identify the **2-3 critical flows** that represent the minimum viable product (MVP). These flows must capture the core value proposition and create a complete user journey that demonstrates the product's purpose.

## üö® The Overbuilding Problem

**Warning**: Designing too many screens and features before validating core value leads to:
- **Feature bloat** that confuses users and dilutes value
- **Development complexity** that slows iteration and increases bugs
- **Team burnout** from building features that don't matter
- **Resource waste** on functionality that users don't need or want
- **Delayed validation** of the core product hypothesis

**Solution**: Identify and focus on the essential flows that deliver core value, then iterate based on user feedback.

## üîç Core Flow Identification Protocol

### 1. **Extract Product Vision**
```text
What is the primary problem this product solves? What is the core value proposition?
```

### 2. **Define User Goals**
```text
What are the primary outcomes users want to achieve? What success looks like for them?
```

### 3. **Identify Essential Actions**
```text
What are the minimum actions a user must take to receive value from this product?
```

### 4. **Map Core Journey**
```text
What is the complete flow from user entry to value delivery? What are the critical touchpoints?
```

### 5. **Validate Completeness**
```text
Does this flow create a complete, satisfying user experience that demonstrates the product's purpose?
```

### 6. **Prioritize by Impact**
```text
Which flows are absolutely essential vs. nice-to-have? What can be deferred to future iterations?
```

## üìã Actionable Prompt Template

Use this structured prompt to identify your core MVP flows:

```
You are identifying the core MVP flows for [INSERT PRODUCT NAME/CONCEPT].

**Product Vision**: [Primary problem solved and core value proposition]

**Target User**: [Who is the primary user and what are their goals?]

**Success Criteria**: [What does success look like for users?]

Identify the 2-3 essential flows that represent the minimum viable product:

1. **Core Value Flow**: What is the primary flow that delivers the main value proposition?
2. **User Onboarding**: How do users get started and understand the product?
3. **Value Reinforcement**: What flow encourages users to return and continue using the product?

For each flow, specify:
- **Purpose**: Why this flow is essential to the MVP
- **User Actions**: What specific steps the user takes
- **Success Metrics**: How you'll know this flow is working
- **Dependencies**: What must be built to support this flow

**Exclude**: Settings, profiles, advanced features, theming, or any non-critical functionality.
```

## üé® Usage Guidelines

### When to Use This Prompt
- **Before starting any UI design or development**
- **When scoping a new product or major feature**
- **When feeling overwhelmed by feature requests**
- **When planning development sprints or milestones**
- **When validating product-market fit**

### What This Prompt Delivers
- **Clear MVP scope** with focused, essential flows
- **Development priorities** that align with core value
- **User journey validation** before building non-essential features
- **Resource allocation guidance** for efficient development

### Integration with Product Development
1. **Use this prompt first** to define your MVP scope
2. **Design and build** only the identified core flows
3. **Test with real users** to validate the core value proposition
4. **Iterate based on feedback** before adding additional features

## üîç Example Usage

**Input**: "I want to build a journaling app that helps people reflect on their day"

**Prompt Application**:
```
You are identifying the core MVP flows for a daily journaling app.

**Product Vision**: Help people develop a daily reflection habit through guided journaling

**Target User**: Busy professionals who want to improve self-awareness and mindfulness

**Success Criteria**: Users complete daily journal entries and feel more reflective/aware

Identify the 2-3 essential flows that represent the minimum viable product:

1. **Core Value Flow**: Daily journal entry creation
2. **User Onboarding**: First-time setup and habit formation
3. **Value Reinforcement**: Viewing past entries and progress

[Follow the detailed specification format above]
```

**Output**: Focused MVP scope with clear development priorities and success metrics.

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

A successful core flows identification should enable you to:
- **Build a focused MVP** that delivers core value quickly
- **Test product-market fit** with minimal development effort
- **Prioritize development** based on user value, not feature requests
- **Avoid scope creep** by clearly defining what's in and out of scope
- **Validate assumptions** before investing in non-essential features

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

After identifying core flows:
1. **Design wireframes** only for the identified core flows
2. **Build the MVP** focusing exclusively on these flows
3. **Test with real users** to validate the core value proposition
4. **Iterate based on feedback** before adding additional features
5. **Expand scope** only after core flows are validated and optimized

Remember: **Core value first, features later**. A focused MVP that delivers clear value is more likely to succeed than a feature-rich product that confuses users.

## üö´ What to Exclude

**Do not include** in your core flows:
- User settings and preferences
- Profile management and customization
- Advanced features and power-user tools
- Social features and sharing
- Analytics and reporting dashboards
- Admin panels and management tools
- Theming and visual customization
- Export/import functionality

These can be added in future iterations after validating the core value proposition.
