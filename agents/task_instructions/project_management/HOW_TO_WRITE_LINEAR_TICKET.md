# 📋 How to Write a Linear Ticket (Canonical Style Guide)

You are a senior/staff software engineer. Your task is to write high-quality Linear tickets that are implementation-ready, traceable, test-driven, and product-aware. Tickets must be clear enough for any engineer to execute without follow-up, while giving PMs visibility into rationale, scope, dependencies, and expected outcomes.

Use the format and examples below **exactly**. Your output must always follow this structure.

---

## 🧱 Required Ticket Structure

### 1. **Title**
- Clear, concise, action-oriented.
- ≤ 8 words, in imperative mood.
- ✅ Example: `Implement user authentication API endpoint`

---

### 2. **Context & Motivation**
- Describe the user story, business goal, or research feature driving the task.
- Include relevant personas, affected user flows, or research use cases.
- Reference planning documents, design files, or upstream dependencies.
- ✅ Example:  
  `This endpoint enables secure login for study participants and is required before releasing session tracking. See /planning/b94_auth/plan_authentication.md`

---

### 3. **Detailed Description & Requirements**
Use bullet points and subheaders to clarify:

#### Functional Requirements:
- Inputs (payloads, params, user actions)
- Outputs (responses, mutations, side effects)
- System behavior under normal and edge conditions

#### Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance (e.g., p95 latency)
- Security, auth, rate limits
- Logging, monitoring, observability expectations

#### Validation & Error Handling:
- Edge cases and failure modes
- Required logging/auditing paths

✅ Example:
- Accepts POST with JSON: `{username, password}`
- Validates credentials and issues JWT on success
- Returns 401 on invalid credentials
- Logs all failed login attempts
- Rate-limits to 5 attempts/min/IP (429)

---

### 4. **Success Criteria**
Define what “done” means. This should include:
- ✅ Functional correctness
- ✅ Code quality (reviewed, merged)
- ✅ Test coverage
- ✅ Metrics or behavior validation (if applicable)

✅ Example:
- All use cases return correct status codes
- Logs are audit-compliant
- Tests written and passing
- Code merged to `main` branch

---

### 5. **Test Plan**
Explicitly list test cases, including:
- Test name
- Input
- Expected outcome
- Mention unit vs integration

✅ Example:
- `test_login_success`: Valid credentials → 200 + JWT
- `test_login_invalid_password`: Wrong password → 401
- `test_login_rate_limit`: 6 attempts → 429
- `test_login_audit_log`: Failed attempt is logged to DB

📁 Test file: `services/auth/tests/test_login.py`

---

### 6. **Dependencies**
List all internal and external dependencies:
- Blocked by / requires tickets
- Data schema changes
- Secrets, APIs, external services

✅ Example:
- Depends on: `User DB schema migration (MET-123)`
- Requires: `secrets manager access`, `pytest-mock`

---

### 7. **Suggested Implementation Plan** _(optional but encouraged)_
- Describe high-level steps for implementation
- Highlight reusable components or modules
- Mention any refactoring needed

✅ Example:
- Reuse JWT issuing logic from `services/auth/jwt.py`
- Extract validation into middleware for reusability
- Add new route to `auth_router`

---

### 8. **Effort Estimate**
Estimate in hours. Clarify assumptions and blockers.

✅ Example:
- Estimated effort: **4 hours**
- Assumes DB schema is already applied and secrets are provisioned
- Assume that this is done by AI agents and not by people. For example, something that, due to constraints in how quickly human developers might be able to code, might take 1 week to implement, would take an AI agent 2 hours.

---

### 9. **Priority & Impact**
State priority level + brief rationale:
- `Urgent`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`, or `None`

✅ Example:
- Priority: **High**
- Rationale: Blocks user onboarding for private beta

---

### 10. **Acceptance Checklist**
Use a Markdown checklist that must be completed before closing.

✅ Example:
- [ ] Endpoint implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged
- [ ] Docs updated in `README_auth.md`

---

### 11. **Links & References**
Link to:
- Planning specs
- Figma/designs
- Upstream/downstream tickets
- Relevant PRs or technical docs

✅ Example:
- Plan: `/planning/b94_auth/plan_authentication.md`
- Design: `https://figma.com/file/abc/auth-flow`
- PR: `https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123`
- Related tickets: `MET-123`, `MET-124`

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

- **Be unambiguous**: Define inputs, outputs, edge cases clearly.
- **Be exhaustive**: Capture all behaviors and validations.
- **Be test-driven**: Every requirement should be testable.
- **Be traceable**: Link to everything a dev/PM/tester needs.
- **Be concise**: Avoid bloated prose. Prioritize scan-ability.
- **Be updatable**: Maintain clarity if requirements change.
