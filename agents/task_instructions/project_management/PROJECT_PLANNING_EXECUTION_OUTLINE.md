# Project Planning and Execution Outline

This document outlines the systematic approach to planning and executing projects, from initial ideation through implementation and delivery. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring comprehensive coverage of requirements, design, and execution planning.

## Phase 1: Initial Brainstorming and Context Gathering

### Objective
Establish a comprehensive understanding of the project requirements, constraints, and context through collaborative exploration with an AI agent.

### Process
1. **Initiate Brainstorming Session**
   - Engage with an AI agent to explore the project concept
   - Capture all initial thoughts, requirements, and questions
   - Document any existing constraints, deadlines, or stakeholder requirements

2. **Create Brain Dump File**
   - Generate `braindump.md` to capture all unstructured thoughts and context
   - Include questions that need answers, potential risks, and initial scope ideas
   - Document any existing research, similar projects, or relevant background information

3. **Identify Knowledge Gaps**
   - List areas requiring further clarification or research
   - Note dependencies on external stakeholders or systems
   - Flag potential technical or business risks that need investigation

### Deliverables
- `braindump.md` containing all initial thoughts and context
- List of questions requiring answers
- Initial scope boundaries and constraints

### Reference Documents
- Use guidance from `WHAT_MAKES_A_GREAT_PROJECT.md` to ensure project quality criteria are met
- Follow conversation style guidelines from `AGENT_CONVERSATION_STYLE.md`

## Phase 2: Requirements Specification and Context Refinement

### Objective
Transform the brain dump into a structured, comprehensive specification that clearly defines what needs to be built and why.

### Process
1. **Follow-up Context Session**
   - Conduct additional conversations with the AI agent to address knowledge gaps
   - Refine and clarify requirements based on the brain dump
   - Explore edge cases, dependencies, and implementation considerations

2. **Create Specification Document**
   - Use the structured approach from `HOW_TO_WRITE_A_SPEC.md`
   - Walk through all five stakeholder-aligned phases:
     - Problem definition and stakeholder identification
     - Success metrics and validation criteria
     - Scope boundaries and technical requirements
     - User experience considerations
     - Technical feasibility and estimation

3. **Validate Specification Completeness**
   - Ensure all stakeholder concerns are addressed
   - Verify that success criteria are measurable and achievable
   - Confirm that scope boundaries are clear and realistic

### Deliverables
- Complete specification document (`spec.md`)
- Clear problem statement and success criteria
- Defined scope boundaries and technical requirements
- Identified stakeholders and dependencies

### Reference Documents
- Follow the comprehensive spec writing process in `HOW_TO_WRITE_A_SPEC.md`
- Ensure alignment with criteria from `WHAT_MAKES_A_GREAT_SPEC.md`

## Phase 3: Project Structure and Tracking Setup

### Objective
Create the organizational structure and tracking mechanisms needed to execute the project effectively.

### Process
1. **Create Linear Project**
   - Use the specification to generate a Linear project following `HOW_TO_WRITE_LINEAR_PROJECT.md`
   - Include clear title, problem statement, objectives, and success criteria
   - Define scope, timeline, team composition, and risk mitigation strategies

2. **Generate Project Tickets**
   - Break down the work into actionable tickets using `HOW_TO_WRITE_LINEAR_TICKET.md`
   - Ensure each ticket is atomic, testable, and has clear acceptance criteria
   - Establish dependencies and priority relationships between tickets

3. **Set Up Project Organization**
   - Create project folder structure as outlined in `HOW_TO_START_NEW_PROJECT.md`
   - Move specification into the project folder
   - Establish any additional documentation or tracking mechanisms

### Deliverables
- Linear project with complete project definition
- Set of well-defined tickets covering all project work
- Organized project folder structure
- Clear tracking and progress monitoring setup

### Reference Documents
- Follow project creation guidelines in `HOW_TO_WRITE_LINEAR_PROJECT.md`
- Use ticket writing standards from `HOW_TO_WRITE_LINEAR_TICKET.md`
- Implement project setup process from `HOW_TO_START_NEW_PROJECT.md`
- Execute tickets following `HOW_TO_EXECUTE_A_TICKET.md` for consistent implementation

## Phase 4: Design and Architecture Planning

### Objective
Develop the technical design and architecture needed to implement the project successfully.

### Process
1. **Technical Design Creation**
   - Develop system architecture and component design
   - Define interfaces, data models, and integration points
   - Consider scalability, maintainability, and performance requirements

2. **User Experience Design**
   - Create wireframes, mockups, or design specifications as needed
   - Ensure alignment with user requirements and success criteria
   - Validate design decisions against project constraints

3. **Implementation Planning**
   - Break down technical work into implementable tasks
   - Identify technical risks and mitigation strategies
   - Plan for testing, deployment, and monitoring requirements

### Deliverables
- Technical design documentation
- User experience specifications
- Implementation plan with task breakdown
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### Reference Documents
- Apply technical criteria from `WHAT_MAKES_A_GREAT_PROJECT.md`
- Follow coding and UI guidelines from the rules directory

## Phase 5: Execution and Delivery

### Objective
Execute the planned work according to the specification and design, ensuring quality delivery.

### Process
1. **Implementation**
   - Execute tickets according to priority and dependencies
   - Maintain code quality and follow established standards
   - Track progress and update Linear tickets regularly

2. **Testing and Validation**
   - Implement comprehensive testing according to acceptance criteria
   - Validate against success metrics defined in the specification
   - Conduct user testing and stakeholder reviews as needed

3. **Deployment and Launch**
   - Plan and execute deployment strategy
   - Monitor performance and user feedback
   - Address any issues and iterate as necessary

### Deliverables
- Completed project implementation
- Test results and validation documentation
- Deployment and launch documentation
- Post-launch monitoring and feedback collection

### Reference Documents
- Follow task planning and prioritization from `TASK_PLANNING_AND_PRIORITIZATION.md`
- Use GitHub operations guidance from `GITHUB_OPERATIONS.md`
- Execute individual tickets following `HOW_TO_EXECUTE_A_TICKET.md`

## Quality Assurance and Continuous Improvement

### Process
1. **Regular Reviews**
   - Conduct periodic reviews of project progress against specification
   - Validate that implementation aligns with original requirements
   - Assess whether success criteria are being met

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Keep all project documentation current
   - Update specifications and tickets as requirements evolve
   - Maintain clear communication with stakeholders

3. **Lessons Learned**
   - Document what worked well and what could be improved
   - Update this outline based on project experiences
   - Share insights with team members for future projects

### Reference Documents
- Apply project quality criteria from `WHAT_MAKES_A_GREAT_PROJECT.md`
- Use ticket quality standards from `WHAT_MAKES_A_GREAT_TICKET.md`
- Follow execution standards from `HOW_TO_EXECUTE_A_TICKET.md`

## Success Criteria

A project following this outline should result in:
- Clear understanding of requirements and context
- Well-defined specification that aligns all stakeholders
- Organized project structure with proper tracking
- Comprehensive design that supports implementation
- Successful delivery meeting all success criteria
- Continuous improvement through lessons learned

This outline ensures systematic coverage of all aspects of project planning and execution while maintaining flexibility to adapt to specific project needs and constraints.
