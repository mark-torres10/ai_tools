# Work Session Analysis Prompt

## Purpose
Extract key insights, patterns, and article-worthy content from AI agent work sessions to inspire future research articles and blog posts.

## When to Use
- After completing a complex debugging session
- Following a significant problem-solving session
- When you've worked through a challenging technical implementation
- After any session where you learned something valuable or encountered interesting patterns

## Analysis Framework

### 1. **Session Context & Problem**
- What was the original problem or challenge we tackled?
- What was the expected vs. actual outcome?
- What made this problem particularly interesting or challenging?
- What was the scope and complexity of the work?

### 2. **Problem-Solving Process**
- What systematic approaches did we use?
- What frameworks or methodologies were applied?
- How did we break down the problem?
- What investigation steps did we follow?

### 3. **Key Insights & Breakthroughs**
- What were the major "aha moments"?
- What assumptions did we challenge or validate?
- What unexpected discoveries did we make?
- What patterns or principles emerged?

### 4. **Pain Points & Learning**
- Where did we get stuck or waste time?
- What approaches didn't work and why?
- What would we do differently next time?
- What debugging or problem-solving techniques proved most valuable?

### 5. **Technical Details**
- What specific tools, frameworks, or technologies were involved?
- What code patterns or architectural decisions were made?
- What performance or scalability considerations came up?
- What integration or compatibility issues did we solve?

### 6. **Article-Worthy Content**
- What lessons would be valuable for other developers?
- What frameworks or approaches could be generalized?
- What common problems did we solve that others face?
- What technical insights could become standalone articles?

### 7. **Quote-Worthy Moments**
- What were the most insightful questions asked?
- What realizations or insights were particularly valuable?
- What framework applications or critical analysis moments stood out?
- What specific advice or principles emerged?

## Output Format
Structure your response with clear headings and bullet points. Include specific examples, quotes, or technical details where relevant. Focus on actionable insights and lessons that could inspire future articles.

**Important**: Write the complete analysis to a file called `temp_writeup.md` in the current directory. This file should contain the full structured analysis following the framework above.

## Success Criteria
A successful analysis should result in:
- Clear understanding of what was accomplished
- Identification of valuable lessons and insights
- Specific examples of frameworks or approaches used
- Actionable takeaways for future work
- Potential article topics or themes
