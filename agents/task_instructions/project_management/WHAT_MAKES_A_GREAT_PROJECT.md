# What makes a great Linear project

## ðŸ§  As an Expert AI Engineer: 5 Criteria for a Great Prompt

### Clarity and Unambiguity
The prompt should avoid vague terms and clearly specify the task, context, and format of the expected output.

### Well-Scoped and Focused
The prompt should have a narrow, well-defined objective. It should avoid combining unrelated tasks or requiring long chains of reasoning unless that is explicitly the goal.

### Includes Sufficient Context
A great prompt includes any necessary background, constraints, or examples the model needs to perform well, minimizing the need for assumptions.

### Action-Oriented and Role-Specific
It should clearly define what role the LLM is taking (e.g., "as a staff engineer...") and what action it is expected to perform (e.g., "write a project ticket", "generate a solution proposal").

### Evaluability of Output
The prompt should make it easy to assess whether the LLM's output is good. This means specifying formats, success criteria, or constraints that guide the LLMâ€™s generation and enable review.

### Customer-Centric Problem Framing
The project should start from a clear articulation of a user need, pain point, or opportunity rooted in research or data.

### Business Impact Alignment
The project must be tied to a clear business goal or OKR, such as improving conversion, reducing churn, or increasing engagement.

### Crisp Definition of Scope
It should define MVP boundaries clearlyâ€”whatâ€™s in scope, whatâ€™s out, and what tradeoffs are accepted to deliver fast learning or iteration.

### Well-Defined Success Metrics
There should be objective and measurable criteria for success (e.g., increase retention by 10%, reduce support tickets by 20%).

### Cross-Functional Readiness
The project should be framed so that engineering, design, marketing, and other partners can understand their roles and move quickly without ambiguity.

## ðŸ”§ As a Staff Engineer: 5 Criteria for a Great Development Project

### Clear Technical Boundaries and Interfaces
The project should define what components, services, or systems are being touched and how they interactâ€”reducing surprises during implementation.

### Feasibility with Current Resources
It should be scoped realistically given existing infrastructure, engineering bandwidth, and tech debt.

### Scalable and Maintainable Design
The project should include or allow for a design that minimizes tech debt, avoids overfitting to short-term hacks, and supports long-term maintainability.

### Risk Awareness and Mitigation Plan
Any major technical or delivery risks should be explicitly identified with mitigation strategies (e.g., rollout plan, feature flags, test coverage).

### Testability and Observability
It must be possible to validate that the implementation works via automated tests, logs, alerts, and/or metrics.
